Academic dishonesty is a serious offense that can diminish the quality of&#160;</span><span>scholarship, the academic environment, the academic reputation and the quality of a Cal Poly&#160;</span><span>Pomona degree. The following policy is intended to define clearly academic dishonesty at Cal&#160;</span><span>Poly Pomona and to state the responsibilities of students, faculty and administrators relating&#160;</span><span>to this subject.</span></div>
<div><br/><span>All forms of academic dishonesty are a violation of university policy and are considered a&#160;</span><span>serious offense. Academic dishonesty is any action that gains an unfair academic advantage&#160;</span><span>and includes, but is not limited to the following.</span></div>
<div></div>
<br/>
<div><span><strong>PLAGIARISM</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Plagiarism is presenting words, ideas or work of others as one's own work. Plagiarism includes copying homework, copying lab reports, copying computer programs, using a work or portion of a work written or created by another but not crediting the source, using one's own work completed in a previous class for credit in another class without permission, paraphrasing another's work without giving credit, and borrowing or using ideas without giving credit.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<br/>
<div><span><strong>CHEATING</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Exam cheating includes unauthorized "crib sheets," copying from another, looking at another student's exam, opening books when not authorized, obtaining advance copies of exams and having an exam regarded after making changes. Exam cheating includes exams given during classes, final exams and standardized tests, such as the Graduate Writing Test.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<br/>
<div><span><strong>UNAUTHORIZED STUDY AIDS</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Includes using others' computer programs or solutions, copying a copyrighted computer program without permission, using old lab reports, having others perform one's share of lab work, and using any material prohibited by the instructor.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<br/>
<div><span><strong>FALSIFYING ANY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENT</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Includes falsifying signatures on university forms, such as add-drop and withdrawal forms, forging another student's signature and falsifying prerequisite requirements.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<br/>
<div><span><strong>CONSEQUENCES FOR ACADEMIC DISHONESTY</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Academic dishonesty cases that occur in the classroom shall be handled by faculty members. However, after action has been taken by the faculty member, the faculty member shall report the incident to Student Conduct and Integrity. Faculty will need to include information that identifies the student who was found responsible, the general nature of the offense, the action taken by the faculty member, and a recommendation as to whether or not additional disciplinary action should be considered by Student Conduct and Integrity. This process provides a central location for all academic dishonesty cases as an opportunity to hold students accountable for multiple academic dishonesty situations that may occur with several departments and as a way to monitor trends in academic dishonesty. Student Conduct and<br/>Integrity will determine appropriate disciplinary action based on the totality of the circumstances.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>Academic outcomes related to academic dishonesty are the responsibility of faculty members. Faculty are encouraged to follow the academic expectations that are outlined in their syllabus. Some common academic actions taken for academic dishonesty may include, but are not limited to: "0" on the assignment, "F" for the course, reduced grade, partial credit, or other sanctions faculty deem appropriate.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>Disciplinary outcomes related to academic dishonesty are determined in accordance with student conduct procedures. Outcomes may include, but are not limited to: warnings, probation, suspension, expulsion, or educational assignments intended to discourage the recurrence of academic dishonesty.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>The responsibility of all students is to be informed of what constitutes academic dishonesty and to follow the policy. A student who is aware of another student's academic dishonesty should report the instance to the instructor of the class, the test administrator, or the head of the department within which the course is offered. Cal Poly Pomona students who come from various international educational systems and wish to understand better the expectations of the American educational system are encouraged to speak with an international student advisor in the International Center.</span></div></p>

                                        <p class="body"><p><span>(a) Campus Community Values: The University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff. Each member of the campus community should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, to be civil to one another and to others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.</span></p>
<p><span>(b) Grounds for Student Discipline: Student behavior that is not consistent with the Student Conduct Code is addressed through an educational process that is designed to promote safety and good citizenship and, when necessary, impose appropriate consequences.</span></p>
<p><span>The following are the grounds upon which student discipline can be based:</span></p>
<p><span>(1) Dishonesty, including:</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(A) Cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty that are intended to gain unfair academic advantage.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (B) Furnishing false information to a University official, faculty member, or campus office.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(C) Forgery, alteration, or misuse of a University document, key, or identification instrument.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(D) Misrepresenting one's self to be an authorized agent of the University or one of its auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span>(2) Unauthorized entry into, presence in, use of, or misuse of University property.</span></p>
<p><span>(3) Willful, material and substantial disruption or obstruction of a University-related activity, or any on-campus activity.</span></p>
<p><span>(4) Participating in an activity that substantially and materially disrupts the normal operations of the University, or infringes on the rights of members of the University community.</span></p>
<p><span>(5) Willful, material and substantial obstruction of the free flow of pedestrian or other traffic, on or leading to campus property or an off-campus University related activity.</span></p>
<p><span>(6) Disorderly, lewd, indecent, or obscene behavior at a University related activity, or directed toward a member of the University community.</span></p>
<p><span>(7) Conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person within or related to the University community, including physical abuse, threats, intimidation, harassment, or sexual misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span>(8) Hazing, or conspiracy to haze. Hazing is defined as any method of initiation or pre-initiation into a student organization or student body, whether or not the organization or body is officially recognized by an educational institution, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution in this state (Penal Code 245.6), and in addition, any act likely to cause physical harm, personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution. The term &#8220;hazing&#8221; does not include customary athletic events or school sanctioned events.</span></p>
<p><span>Neither the express or implied consent of a victim of hazing, nor the lack of active participation in a particular hazing incident is a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not a neutral act, and is also a violation of this section.</span></p>
<p><span>(9) Use, possession, manufacture, or distribution of illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, (except as expressly permitted by law and University regulations) or the misuse of legal pharmaceutical drugs.</span></p>
<p><span>(10) Use, possession, manufacture, or distribution of alcoholic beverages (except as expressly permitted by law and University regulations), or public intoxication while on campus or at a University related activity.</span></p>
<p><span>(11) Theft of property or services from the University community, or misappropriation of University resources.</span></p>
<p><span>(12) Unauthorized destruction, or damage to University property or other property in the University community.</span></p>
<p><span>(13)&#160;Possession or misuse of firearms or guns, replicas, ammunition, explosives, fireworks, knives, other weapons, or dangerous chemicals (without the prior authorization of the campus president) on campus or at a University related activity.</span></p>
<p><span>(14) Unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of academic presentations (including handwritten notes) for a commercial purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>(15) Misuse of computer facilities or resources, including:</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; (A) Unauthorized entry into a file, for any purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(B) Unauthorized transfer of a file.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(C) Use of another's identification or password.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(D) Use of computing facilities, campus network, or other resources to interfere with the work of another member of the University community.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (E) Use of computing facilities and resources to send obscene or intimidating and abusive messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(F) Use of computing facilities and resources to interfere with normal University operations.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(G) Use of computing facilities and resources in violation of copyright laws.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;(H) Violation of a campus computer use policy.</span></p>
<p><span>(16) Violation of any published University policy, rule, regulation or presidential order.</span></p>
<p><span>(17) Failure to comply with directions or, or interference with, any University official or any public safety officer while acting in the performance of his/her duties.</span></p>
<p><span>(18) Any act chargeable as a violation of a federal, state, or local law that poses a substantial threat to the safety or well being of members of the University community, to property within the University community or poses a significant threat of disruption or interference with University operations.</span></p>
<p><span>(19) Violation of the Student Conduct Procedures, including:</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(A) Falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation of information related to a student discipline matter.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(B) Disruption or interference with the orderly progress of a student discipline proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(C) Initiation of a student discipline proceeding in bad faith.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(D) Attempting to discourage another from participating in the student discipline matter.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(E) Attempting to influence the impartiality of any participant in a student discipline matter.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(F) Verbal or physical harassment or intimidation of any participant in a student discipline matter.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (G) Failure to comply with the sanction(s) imposed under a student discipline proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>(20) Encouraging, permitting, or assisting another to do any act that could subject him or her to discipline.</span></p>
<p><span>(c) Procedures for Enforcing This Code: The Chancellor shall adopt procedures to ensure students are afforded appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the University imposes any sanction for a violation of the Student Conduct Code.</span></p>
<p><span>(d) Application of This Code: Sanctions for the conduct listed above can be imposed on applicants, enrolled students, students between academic terms, graduates awaiting degrees, and students who withdraw from school while a disciplinary matter is pending. Conduct that threatens the safety or security of the campus community, or substantially disrupts the functions or operation of the University is within the jurisdiction of this Article regardless of whether it occurs on or off campus. Nothing in this Code may conflict with Education Code Section 66301 that prohibits disciplinary action against students based on behavior protected by the First Amendment.</span></p></p>

Involved students and witnesses may be contacted to schedule a meeting. The meeting is an opportunity for the student to explain what happened from the student&#8217;s perspective. The meeting is educational, not adversarial, and students are expected to be honest and forthcoming during the process.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>After the investigation is completed, one of two outcomes may occur:</strong></span><br/><span>(1) It will be determined that the student did not violate the Student Conduct Code and the</span><br/><span>case will be dismissed;</span><br/><span>(2) It will be determined that the student has violated the Student Conduct Code and</span><br/><span>appropriate consequences or sanctions will be assessed.</span></p>
<p><br/><span><strong>If the student is found responsible for violating the Student Conduct Code, the case will be</strong></span><br/><span><strong>adjudicated by one of two processes:</strong></span><br/><span>(1) The student will be offered a written Resolution Agreement in which the student accepts the</span><br/><span>university charges, the consequences that have been assessed, and the student waives the</span><br/><span>right to a hearing.</span><br/><span>(2) The student rejects the Resolution Agreement and the process proceeds to a formal</span><br/><span>hearing.</span></p>

Any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation or other crimes designed to infringe upon those rights will be given the utmost priority. The University and University Police are dedicated to maintaining a cooperative effort with local, state and federal agencies as well as the community we serve toward the immediate investigation of reported hate crimes and hate-related incidents, and prosecution and/or University sanctions as appropriate This policy provides: (a) guidelines for identifying and investigating reportable crimes and&#160;</span><span>incidents and (b) the resources to which victims can be referred for assistance.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span><strong>DEFINITIONS OF HATE-MOTIVATED CRIMES AND INCIDENTS</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Hate Crime: Any unlawful action designed to frighten, harm, injure, intimidate or harass an individual, in whole or in part, because of a bias motivation against the actual or perceived race, religion,&#160; ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim.</span></p>
<p><span>Hate Incident: Not all expressions of hate or group bias rise to the level of a hate crime as defined in state and federal statute. A noncriminal act or incident, while not criminal, is done with the apparent intention to: harass, intimidate, threaten, retaliate, and create conflict, because of a person's race, ethnic/national origin, religious belief, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Reporting and monitoring of hate incidents is important, as they may serve as&#160;</span><span>indicators of potential threats and/or campus climate that may escalate into criminal acts.</span><br/><br/><br/><span><strong>REPORTING AND REFERRALS FOR HATE-MOTIVATED CRIMES AND INCIDENTS</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The University Police Department is responsible for collecting and reporting hate-motivated statistics. Hate-motivated crimes and incidents may be reported to the following locations on campus:</span></p>

                                        <p class="body"><p><span>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits discrimination based on gender (including sexual harassment and sexual violence) in educational programs which receive federal financial assistance. Areas of the institution where Title IX may have application include athletics, student recruitment and admissions, financial aid, scholarships, course offerings and access, employment, and residential housing services. Title IX also protects all students and employees from sexual harassment in university programs and activities, as well as sexual assault/sexual misconduct, which are both forms of discrimination under Title IX.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A form of sex discrimination, this is an unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that includes, but is not limited to, sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and any other conduct of a sexual nature where:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct is explicitly or implicitly used as the basis for any decision affecting a complainant's status or progress, or access to benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through the university; or</span></li>
<li><span>The conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, whether or not intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the shoes of the complainant, and is in fact considered by the complainant, as limiting his or her ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by the university; or</span></li>
<li><span>The conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, whether or not&#160; intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the shoes of the complainant, and is in fact considered by the complainant, as creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Sexual Harassment also includes acts of verbal, non-verbal or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on Gender or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</strong></span></p>
<p><span>All sexual activity between members of the CSU community must be based on Affirmative Consent. Engaging in any sexual activity without first obtaining Affirmative Consent to the specific sexual activity is Sexual Misconduct (including Sexual Assault, Sexual Battery, and Rape) and constitutes a violation of our University policy: CSU Executive Order 1097.&#160;To better understand your rights and options regarding the University&#8217;s process of addressing reports of sexual misconduct, please visit the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/officeofequity/">Office of Equity and Compliance.</a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>SEXUAL ACTIVITY</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Includes but is not limited to kissing, touching intimate body parts, fondling, intercourse, penetration of any body part, and oral sex.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT</strong></span></p>
<p><span>An informed, affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and mutual agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure Affirmative Consent has been obtained from the other participant(s) to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean Affirmative Consent, nor does silence mean Affirmative Consent.</span></p>
<p><span>Affirmative Consent must be voluntary, and given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation. The existence of a dating or social relationship between those involved, or the fact of past sexual activities between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of Affirmative Consent. A request for someone to use a condom or birth control does not, in and of itself, constitute Affirmative Consent.</span></p>
<p><span>Affirmative Consent can be withdrawn or revoked. Consent to one form of sexual activity (or one sexual act) does not constitute consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent given to sexual activity on one occasion does not constitute consent on another occasion. There must always be mutual and affirmative consent to engage in sexual activity. Consent</span><br/><span>must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time, including after penetration. Once consent is withdrawn or revoked, the sexual activity must stop immediately.</span></p>
<p><br/><span><strong>DATING VIOLENCE</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Abuse committed by a person who is or has been in a social or dating relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. This may include someone the victim just met; i.e., at a party, introduced through a friend, or on a social networking website. For purposes of this definition, &#8220;abuse&#8221; means intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to self or another. Abuse does not include non-physical, emotional distress or injury.</span></p>
<p><br/><span><strong>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Abuse committed against someone who is a current or former spouse; cohabitant; someone with whom the Respondent has a child; someone with whom the Respondent has or had a dating or engagement relationship; or a person similarly situated under California domestic or family violence law. Abuse as defined under CSU Executive Order 1097 does not include nonphysical, emotional distress or injury.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>STALKING</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Engaging in a repeated course of conduct (two or more acts) directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for the safety of self or others&#8217; safety or to suffer substantial emotional distress.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT CAN I DO?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Medical Help<br/></strong>Student Health Services provide treatment of injuries, STD screenings, and pregnancy tests. If you wish to have an evidence collection kit (&#8220;rape kit&#8221;), you can do so by visiting Pomona Valley Hospital. If possible and to preserve evidence, do not wash your face or hands, shower or bathe, brush your teeth, urinate or change clothes prior to doing the medical exam.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To Report and Get Support</strong><br/>Students who wish to come forward as survivors may seek assistance from faculty or staff. Faculty and staff will support the survivor, however, to further protect the survivor and the campus community, they cannot guarantee confidentiality. The student can also contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance to report any form of interpersonal violence. Students may also seek assistance from Survivor Advocacy Services and/or Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), who can explain their options and resources available for them.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What if I Want to be Left Alone?</strong><br/>This may be a confusing and difficult time. Remember that these resources are always available to you, and you can seek support at any time. Friends and family can also offer support. You are not alone, and you have options. It is your choice.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To Talk</strong><br/>Survivor Advocacy Services is a confidential resource who can provide you with support while allowing you the time and space you need to process what has happened and who can provide you with basic information about your options and available resources.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To Report a Criminal Concern</strong><br/>Sexual violence is a crime. We encourage you to contact the University Police Department or the police department responsible for the area where the incident took place. A criminal investigation does not relieve the university of its obligation to respond to Title IX. Both criminal and university investigations can proceed at the same time.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>To Understand the University's Process for Addressing Sexual Misconduct</strong><br/>We encourage you to contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance who oversees the review of all reports of sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. In certain rare<br/>circumstances where it is necessary to ensure your safety and the safety of the university's community, the university may be obligated to investigate known incidents of sexual misconduct, even if you may not<br/>feel ready. Such decision would be discussed with you in advance, and the university would ensure you have a support person throughout the process.</span></p></p>

This policy prohibits all methods of smoking including but not limited to e-cigarettes and vaping. University Housing Services does not permit smoking inside any part of the housing facility, including individual units and balconies/patios/porches or ledges.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Smoke Free&#8221; means the use of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and other &#8220;smoke&#8221; emanating products including e-cigarettes, vapor devices and other like products are prohibited on all University properties. Smoke or Smoking: &#8220;Smoke&#8221; or &#8220;Smoking&#8221; means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, cigarillo, pipe, hookah, or any other lighted or heated tobacco or plant product intended for inhalation, whether natural or synthetic, in any manner or in any form. &#8220;Smoke&#8221; or &#8220;Smoking&#8221; also includes the use of an electronic smoking device that creates an aerosol or vapor, in any manner or in any form, or the use of any oral smoking device for the purpose of circumventing the prohibition of smoking.</span></p>
<p><span>Compliance is grounded in an informed and educated campus community. The success of this policy depends on the thoughtfulness, civility and cooperation of all members of the campus community, including visitors. Members of the CSU community are individually responsible to comply with the creation of a systemwide smoke and tobacco free environment. While compliance with this executive order is an individual responsibility, members of the CSU</span><br/><span>community should be aware that enforcement of this policy may occur in the following instances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>University Police shall reserve all enforcement authority with regards to any violation of</span><br/><span>existing state and federal law.</span></li>
<li><span>Individual agreements that prohibit smoking and proscribe penalties for breaches that are</span><br/><span>not impacted by this executive order (e.g. University Housing license agreements, other</span><br/><span>residential licenses, or existing leases).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Educational campaigns, outreach, communication and the promotion of tobacco cessation treatment options will be the primary means to promote compliance. A comprehensive education and outreach campaign, including resources and referrals for cessation will be made available as part of campus implementation programs.</span></p>
<p><span>The progress this policy represents in promoting the ability of students, faculty, staff and visitors to have a healthier and pleasant campus experience aligns well with the CSU&#8217;s mission.</span></p>
<p><span>Student violations of this policy will be subject to CSU student disciplinary procedures established pursuant to Section 41301, Title 5, of the California Code of Regulations. The policy prohibiting smoking is available online at&#160;<a href="https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/6591951/latest/">the CSU website.</a></span></p></p>

Civility, understanding, and mutual respect are intrinsic to excellence in teaching, learning and maintaining a productive work environment. The university is also committed to providing a safe and healthy campus culture, which serves the needs of its many constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span>The University prohibits and will take decisive action to eliminate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Verbal or written harassment</span></li>
<li><span>Behaviors or actions interpreted by a reasonable person as carrying the potential for violence and/or acts of aggression such as:</span></li>
<li><span>Acts which can be interpreted as physical assault</span></li>
<li><span>Threats to harm someone or endanger the safety of others</span></li>
<li><span>Threats to destroy or the actual destruction of property</span></li>
<li><span>Possession of a weapon</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Such conduct is subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from employment, expulsion from the university, or civil or criminal prosecution, as appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span>To fulfill this policy, the university will work to prevent violence from occurring and will ensure that federal and state laws, as well as university regulations prohibiting violence, are enforced. In determining whether conduct constitutes a credible threat or act of violence, the circumstances surrounding the conduct will be considered.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the responsibility of every administrator, faculty member, staff member, and student to take any threat of violence seriously. All threats must be reported to the appropriate authority. Failure to report any threat is subject to disciplinary action. Managers/supervisors can also be held responsible for civil and personal liability. When confronted by an imminent or actual incident of violence, call 9-1-1 immediately. When presented with a threat of possible violence, action is recommended as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Threats by a student should be reported immediately to the University Police Department and the Director of Student Conduct and Integrity.</span></li>
<li><span>Threats by a staff or student employee should be reported immediately to the University&#160;Police Department and the reporting employee's supervisor, who will contact the Associate Vice President for Human Resource Services for assistance.</span></li>
<li><span>Threats by a faculty member should be reported immediately to the University Police Department and the appropriate Dean's Office for consultation with the Associate Vice President for Faculty Affairs.</span></li>
<li><span>Threats from others not affiliated as a student or employee of the university should be reported immediately to the University Police Department.</span></li>
