civil engin b s environment engin the environment engin option includ a rang of civil engin coursework with an emphasi on air and water qualiti biolog and water suppli system this option is particular appeal to student who are interest in develop remedi strategi for contamin site design and manag drink water wastewat and storm water system and reduc wast stream and energi use environment engin is recogn by the u s depart of labor as one of the fastest grow field in engin sanitari landfil provid safe dispos of municip wast thus protect the environ the pipelin shown in the photo collect methan gas from the landfil which is then use to generat electr environment engin focus on engin work that clean and protect the environ these project can includ design facil to safe handl solid wast industri wast or municip wastewat it also can includ identifi and remedi exist pollut such as underground contamin plume it has been said that civil engin have save more live than doctor and much of this benefit has come from environment engin civil engin b s geospati engin the geospati engin option includ a rang of civil engin coursework with an emphasi on survey remot sens photogrammetri geograph inform system and global posit system this option prepar student to ultim becom licens civil engin and licens land surveyor and thus is especi attract for those who intend to becom land develop engin use a survey instrument to record topograph data in the field geospati engin includ survey map remot sens and other similar activ geospati engin use precis global posit system gps receiv
