student by step up to help out in the field as well as the classroom he aim to do well and we re veri proud he reach that goal q a with state geologist jeremi lancast 1 tell me about your time here at cpp what was it like my time at cal poli pomona was veri enjoy i start as an environment engin major potenti do geolog as a minor when i start do geolog i just love it it reson part of it was the access of instructor befor and after class be abl to have discuss about engin geolog dr larri herbert who is recent deceas was a hard charger he push peopl i appreci that there were high expect the learn by do reson with me we spent time in the field look at rock look at fault look at landslid everi 2 3 week i was out in the field i did a senior field studi through south dakota school of mine and the univers of east illinoi most student in that field camp were from the midwest and we had a massiv leg up in term of field identif we ran circl around their top student becaus we had been in the field so mani time look at miner rock and the geolog framework of the earth 2 how did you becom interest in geolog for part of my childhood i live by joshua tree and spent a lot of time enter mine do archeolog investig and look for miner like gold copper and pyrit with an adventur dad it s probabl whi geolog reson with me it felt like home 3 how did your educ at cpp prepar you for work there were three or four cours and the professor who taught them that were foundat to me jon nours taught geotecton from the macro scale of earth s plate structur crustal plate and how they interact with the mantl and move down to the micro scale at fault level with earthquak it was the teach in that cours that translat into a strong interest in geohazard i took geomorpholog with larri herbert it had a lot to do with landslid i did a senior thesi on landslid in chino hill and map 60 squar mile of landslid that thesi was a springboard for my career i ve work 24 year in my career and 80 was in landslid also with jon nours i took geotechnolog which is also hazard focus and it expos me to thing like when build a dam how to look for landslid and fault that might impact a dam and how water destabil hillslop and retain wall 4 did you have mentor at cpp both jon nours and larri herbert were mentor to me larri was a great mentor he put a lot in front of me he was alway encourag me to learn he led me to discov how much i could learn on my own he d say i need you to do these thing but there are these other thing whi don t you think about them too he was a veri posit gentleman jon nours is someon who realli enjoy the geoscienc and was alway will to explain someth or talk about geolog the thing i realli appreci about him is he can take a veri complex subject and break it down into veri basic understand languag over the year i ve had to learn to communic to non scientist and jon was a great model in this respect 5 are there ani trend in geolog that current student should focus on there are a lot of trend toward more comput analysi in the geoscienc those are import but field truth the work is just as import don t lose sight of it you might have the greatest model on earth but if you don t know how to collect the basic data that goe into the model and the error associ with the data or how to test the model with field truth you re realli miss an import factor that will add to the accuraci and credibl of your work advanc tool are amaz but you still need to get out and look at the ground look at the rock see if your model make sens 6 what advic would you give colleg student in term of prepar for their career stay curious and keep learn keep your head down and work hard don t worri about make mistak learn from them alway look at a situat no matter how pain that you re go to learn from it and it will make you better at the end of our career we re an express of everyth we ve experienc the more challeng you ve had the stronger it make you hardship and mistak
