		<meta content="California State Polytechnic University, Pomona is the only public university in Southern California offering a Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) degree. Established in 1972 by John T. Lyle, our fully-accredited program has a rich history of developing professionals who move into leadership positions in public, private and non-profit sectors.&#13;&#10;Landscape architecture is a STEM* discipline integrating knowledge of ecological systems, social systems, human behavior, technology, the arts and the humanities in the development of solutions to societyâ€™s most pressing challenges, including responses to climate change and inequities. The consequences of climate change threaten the health of natural ecosystems, and the health of cities and populations potentially exposed to extreme heat, drought, changing weather patterns and sea level rise. These impacts only exacerbate historic inequities in our society concerning exposure to environmental negatives such as pollution, as well as access to environmental positives such as parks, healthy foods, natural experiences, and safe streets." name="description"/>

                                                <p>Landscape architecture is a STEM* discipline integrating knowledge of ecological systems, social systems, human behavior, technology, the arts and the humanities in the development of solutions to society&#8217;s most pressing challenges, including responses to climate change and inequities. The consequences of climate change threaten the health of natural ecosystems, and the health of cities and populations potentially exposed to extreme heat, drought, changing weather patterns and sea level rise. These impacts only exacerbate historic inequities in our society concerning exposure to environmental negatives such as pollution, as well as access to environmental positives such as parks, healthy foods, natural experiences, and safe streets.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of our MLA program is to develop leaders in evidence-based landscape architecture, who are proactive, creative in leveraging opportunities, and socially conscious of their actions. The curriculum stresses academic excellence focused on developing awareness of current issues and opportunities, experimenting with innovative methods and technologies to develop solutions, and synthesizing interdisciplinary knowledge, community-based knowledge, connecting personal values to analyses, policies, and designs at multiple scales. We use evidence that support the planning and design process is derived from academic research literature, community engagement, and the wealth of data that is increasingly accessible to inform decision-making and design.</p>
<h3>Education Goals</h3>
<p>To accomplish this mission, our MLA curriculum is grounded in the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cultivating leadership to address pressing environmental and social challenges facing communities.</li>
<li>Developing strength in design as an iterative process engaging multiple scales.</li>
<li>Effectively utilizing data and evidence to inform decision-making and design.</li>
<li>Grounding insights and solutions in academic research literature.</li>
<li>Developing a sophisticated understanding of community engagement on a continuum between extractive and empowering practice.&#160;</li>
<li>Understanding historical and theoretical foundations of diverse traditions in landscape architecture.</li>

<p>Since 1972, the M.L.A. program at Cal Poly Pomona has built an expansive legacy of human eco-systematic landscape design as initiated by the late professor John T. Lyle (1934-1998) and contributed by generations of faculty and students. The human eco-systematic focus is featured with extensive research into the bio-physical and socio-cultural inventory of the landscape system and the interplay among them; in-depth analysis on the patterns, trends, and relations of highly relevant natural and social processes and other playing factors; considerate programming based on client, stakeholder, and community input collected via social surveys, public meetings, focused groups, and activities; rational systematic planning to create strong sustainability and connectivity; and creative site design solutions to construct vibrant, safe, and cultural friendly places. It serves as the major studio approach in projects ranging from watershed master planning, urban park plan design, open space and habitat management, greenways and trail system planning, stormwater infrastructure planning and design, multi-functional landscape systems, community landscape stewardship, brown and gray field revitalization, etc.</p>
<h3>Current Issues and Trends</h3>
<p>While its foundation on human eco-systematic landscape design continues, the program embraces new directions reflecting the ever-changing issues and needs of the landscape and human society that calls for new theories, principles and methods. These new directions in the curriculum include but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Climate change adaption design, which address knowledge on landscape mitigation strategies that if employed at mass scale, can help reduce GHG emissions (ASLA, 2016), adjust global and micro-climate, protect natural resources and wildlife habitats, promote local agriculture, and foster community resiliency against climate change;</li>
<li>Participatory design and social practice, which seeks to create places that reflect and serve diverse cultural, racial and economic communities by involving users in the entire process of creating and improving their own landscape.</li>
<li>Geodesign, which embraces and utilizes big data, Artifical Intelligence (AI), machine-learning and other latest geospatial technologies to empower human capability in scientific rationalization and sophisticated outreach and engagement to public agencies and various stakeholders to address complex and systematic landscape design challenges that are otherwise difficult to address; and</li>
<li>Urban sustainable landscape design that brings in creative landscape strategies to sequester carbon, clean the air and water, increase energy efficiency, restore habitats, and create value through significant economic, social and, environmental benefits (ASLA, 2016).</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, CPP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/env/lyle/">John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies</a> and the other graduate programs offered by the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/env/index.shtml">College of Environmental Design</a> (ENV) and CPP provide a tremendous range of electives for our students.</p>
<h3>MLA Program Tracks</h3>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>MLA Application Portfolio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A portfolio (20 pages maximum) that showcases your creativity is required. Examples of portfolios are available by emailing <a href="mailto:MLA@cpp.edu">MLA@cpp.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The PDF of your portfolio can be submitted via <a href="mailto:MLA@cpp.edu?subject=MLA%20Applicant%20Portfolio">email</a>, via a file sharing site (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, et cetera) or digital portfolio publishing site (ISSUU or other) with the URL submitted by <a href="mailto:MLA@cpp.edu?subject=MLA%20Applicant%20Portfolio">email</a> or the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/sKbrY1Q6XD">Supplemental Application</a>, or by printing a copy and mailing it to us (address is above). Mailed portfolios will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong><em>Portfolio Content</em></strong></p>
<p>Your portfolio does not need to feature landscape design work or be landscape architecture related. We recognize that many candidates come from academic backgrounds with little to no art or design experience. Feel free to include work that you think provides evidence that you are a creative thinker and problem solver. For example, past students have submitted knitting patterns, dance routines, cake decorating, original recipes, musical scores or recording, and computer programs that illustrate their creative problem-solving abilities. Please provide a sufficient explanation about each project to assist so our faculty can interpret your process and the significance of your accomplishment.</p>
<p>Each project or type of project should have dedicated pages.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to include a sample of your writing (up to 10 pages) in the portfolio - this could be a few pages from a report, a chapter out of a thesis, article, etc.</p>
<p>A resume is recommended for Advanced Standing applicants, and is optional for General Standing applicants.</p>
<p>To include videography/animation, performing arts/music, or interact media work in your portfolio, please include frame grabs/still images + URL to view/hear the full work (don&#8217;t embed the file in the PDF as this will bloat the file size). <em>Audio or video media files under 20mb can submitted via email separately from your PDF portfolio file. Media files larger than 20mb must be submitted by providing a URL to them on cloud sharing website via email.&#160;</em></p>
<p>For any group/collaborative project, or professional work completed as an employee, please be sure to specify the role you played in the project, and to identify the other team members.</p>
<p>All portfolios require a cover page with your name, contact information, address, phone number, email, and the program to which you are applying (MLA 1 or MLA 2).</p>
<p><em>Portfolio Formatting and Creation Instructions</em></p>
<p>Your portfolio should be submitted as single multi-page PDF file (or printed), with no more than 20 pages (8.5x11/letter-size or A4 size paper). Please don&#8217;t combine 2-page spreads into single 11x17 pages. PDF files are preferred.</p>
<p>To create your portfolio, there many apps that allow you to easily layout multiple pages with a combination of images and text, such as: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, MS Word, Google Docs, PowerPoint, or Keynote. It is essential that any software used allows saving the final version as a PDF. Any Windows, MacOS, and iOS app should be able to do this, either by &#8216;save as&#8230;&#8217; in the file menu or in the print dialog window.</p>
<p>If you will not be printing your portfolio, you will generate a smaller file that displays better on a screen with images that are 8-bit RGB color mode or 8-bit gray scale (not CMYK or 12-bit color). Please optimize your image files so they have a final resolution of 100 to 200 pixels per inch using a photo editing application, by using the &#8216;compress images&#8217; tool available in many apps, or in the &#8216;save as&#8217; options. Higher resolution images will bloat the file size and are not recommended. For an image that is reproduced as 6&#8221; x 4&#8221; in the portfolio, the resolution should be at least 600x400 pixels and no more than 1200x800 pixels.</p>
<p>If you only can provide a hard copy printed version of portfolio, please mail it to the Department address above. Printed portfolios should be printed on both sides of the page (double-sided), and bound to be easily opened/accessed and easy to leaf through (use staples, spiral or comb bindings, or insert the pages into a folio/binder). No loose pages/sheets accepted. Printed portfolios WILL NOT BE RETURNED, so please do not spend lots of money on a fancy binder/cover.</p>
<p>See the file name format instructions above.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Foundation: Human Eco-Systematic Landscape Design</h3>
<p>Since 1972, the M.L.A. program at Cal Poly Pomona has built an expansive legacy of human eco-systematic landscape design as initiated by the late professor John T. Lyle (1934-1998) and contributed by generations of faculty and students. The human eco-systematic focus is featured with extensive research into the bio-physical and socio-cultural inventory of the landscape system and the interplay among them; in-depth analysis on the patterns, trends, and relations of highly relevant natural and social processes and other playing factors; considerate programming based on client, stakeholder, and community input collected via social surveys, public meetings, focused groups, and activities; rational systematic planning to create strong sustainability and connectivity; and creative site design solutions to construct vibrant, safe, and cultural friendly places. It serves as the major studio approach in projects ranging from watershed master planning, urban park plan design, open space and habitat management, greenways and trail system planning, stormwater infrastructure planning and design, multi-functional landscape systems, community landscape stewardship, brown and gray field revitalization, etc.</p>
<p>While its foundation on human eco-systematic landscape design continues, the program embraces new directions reflecting the ever-changing issues and needs of the landscape and human society that calls for new theories, principles and methods. These new directions in the curriculum include but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Climate change adaption design, which address knowledge on landscape mitigation strategies that if employed at mass scale, can help reduce GHG emissions (ASLA, 2016), adjust global and micro-climate, protect natural resources and wildlife habitats, promote local agriculture, and foster community resiliency against climate change;</li>
<li>Participatory design and social practice, which seeks to create places that reflect and serve diverse cultural, racial and economic communities by involving users in the entire process of creating and improving their own landscape.</li>
<li>Geodesign, which embraces and utilizes big data and the latest geospatial technologies to empower human capability in scientific rationalization to address complex and systematic landscape design challenges that are otherwise difficult to address; and</li>
<li>Urban sustainable landscape design that brings in creative landscape strategies to sequester carbon, clean the air and water, increase energy efficiency, restore habitats, and create value through significant economic, social and, environmental benefits (ASLA, 2016).</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, CPP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/env/lyle/">John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies</a> and the other graduate programs offered by the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/env/index.shtml">College of Environmental Design</a> (ENV) and CPP provide a tremendous range of electives for our students.</p>

<p>A minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA is required in all courses taken to earn as part of the MLA program in order to receive the degree. A "C" or better grade is required for students to receive credit toward the MLA program. Please refer to the University Catalog and Graduate Studies for more information. All MLA Coursework must be completed within 7 years of beginning the program.</p>
<p>Students admitted with General Standing need to complete all General Standing courses (15 units) + MLA Core Courses (36-units) + 9-units of MLA Electives + either Project or Thesis Track courses (12-units) = 72-units.</p>
<p>Advanced Standing students take the MLA Core Courses (36-units) + 9-units of Electives + either Project or Thesis Track Course (12-units) = 48-units.</p>

<p>Student assistantships occasionally are offered by the department on a case by case basis. Tuition for in-state students is quite inexpensive and domestic students from outside of California are eligible for in-state residency after one year. See Cost, Scholarships, Awards, and Financial Aid Resources section for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I be employed while in the program?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many landscape architecture job opportunities in the Los Angeles area and many students are employed while studying in the graduate program. Based on experience, it is recommended that students do not take jobs in their first year and take no more than 15 hours per week in their second and third year. The program&#8217;s courses are generally concentrated during three of the five working days (Monday, Wednesday and Friday), allowing students time to be engaged outside of class with studies and employment. The last six months of the program, when students are engaged in their cumulating experience, are quite intense and students usually reduce workloads during that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where should I live while attending Cal Poly Pomona?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many students live in nearby communities of Pomona, Claremont, La Verne, Pasadena, West Covina, and elsewhere. Commuting long distances is workable, but at times difficult and moving closer to campus should be considered. On-campus housing is also available through <a href="http://www.cpp.edu/&#126;housing/index.shtml">http://www.cpp.edu/&#126;housing/index.shtml</a> and through the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies <a href="http://env.cpp.edu/rs">http://env.cpp.edu/rs.</a> During the pandemic, teaching will be offered online and thus you can live wherever you want as long as you have good internet connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the University offer housing option for married couples?</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the university does not offer housing for married couples. There are many options at affordable cost in neighborhoods around campus, such as Pomona, Claremont, La Verne, Diamond Bar, Rowland Height, Chino Hills etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I visit classes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to visit campus at any time. A map is on the campus website (<u>http://</u> <a href="http://www.cpp.edu/maps/static/">www.cpp.edu/maps/static/)</a> and our graduate studios are in Building 2, rooms 128, 129, and 130. Other classrooms are for the department are in building 3 and 7. The <u>department website</u> will announce special presentations and year-end juries as well. Mondays tend to be the best days to visit the program because classes for all three years of the graduate program meet on Mondays and you can see a good cross-section of the program. Class visit opportunities are along available online during the pandemic. Reach out to the graduate coordinator (<a href="mailto:mla@cpp.edu">mla@cpp.edu</a>) for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there an optimal time to apply?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. For both domestic and international students, endeavor to submit all required materials early in January so that transcripts may be analyzed by the admissions office prior to the deadline.</p>
<ul>
<li>When will I know if I am accepted into the program?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the March 1st deadline for submitting materials, packages will be reviewed and acceptance/waiting list letters sent out in early April. Notification of acceptance is expected from admitted applicants by April 15th and then invitations are extended to waiting list candidates to fill any available spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do your alumni work following graduation?</li>
</ul>
<p>CPP MLA graduates are exceptional candidates for a wide range of landscape architecture careers in both private design firms and public sectors. MLA graduates working in private and public sections are about half-half. Public sectors which hired our graduates include but not limited to federal, state, regional and local governments and agencies as well as environmental and social none-profit organizations. Private sectors which hired our graduates include but not limited to large interdisciplinary design and planning firms, environmental consulting groups, as well as small landscape design and construction firms. In addition, there is a good portion of our alumni run their own landscape design and landscaping business in Los Angeles region and beyond.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I have to write two different letters of Intent?</li>
</ul>
<p>No. The statement of intent submitted with your online application at <u>Cal State Apply</u> may be the same statement of intent that you submit to the Landscape Architecture Department.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the University's policy on admission deferment?</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not defer admission as it is both CSU and Campus Policy. Students who would like to attend in a future term, must reapply as returning applicant (see application procedure section for details) for the desired term of attendance.</p>
<ul>
<li>When should I submit my transcript if I am still finishing my Bachelor Degree while applying for the MLA program?</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to submit your transcript as soon as you receive your degree from your current university/college. Without the document submitted to the Office of Admission and Outreach, you will not be able to register and start your study in the program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is tuition waiver available for incoming students? How about graduate assistantship?</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the CSU system, Cal Poly Pomona offers one of the lowest tuitions in the nation and thus is very affordable (see Tuition section for more information). Tuition waiver is unfortunately not available in the CSU system for its tuition is relatively low compared to other universities. Graduate assistantship is available at case-by-case situation after the students have been in the program for at least one semester. In another word, assistantship is normally not available to incoming students.</p>
