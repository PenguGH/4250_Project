Erickson claimed her degree in food and nutrition in 1980 and has since managed quality assurance procurement and distribution management through supply chains for several restaurant corporations Most people outside the food business didn t know what a supply chain was Then COVID 19 came along A food supply chain refers to the multiple steps that move food from the farm to the kitchen table The economic shutdowns during the pandemic resulted in nationwide shortages and delivery delays The restaurant industry is dynamic but the supply chain is at the core of everything Erickson says COVID 19 was a wake up call for the CEOs who are realizing the importance of having a strong supply chain team Erickson credits her parents for encouraging her and her two sisters to have careers and Cal Poly for preparing her to thrive in the working world Our parents raised us to believe we were capable of doing whatever we set our minds to do she says There was more talk of careers than in marrying and having children As an adult I realized my upbringing wasn t typical for girls at that time Erickson recalls the classes at Cal Poly Pomona that had the biggest impact on her was a series on quantity food production taught by Ruthanna A Davis We had to design a blueprint for a food production facility including everything from equipment to the menu I still have the blueprint she says Erickson has worked for Denny s Restaurants Carl Karcher Enterprises Del Taco and Brinker International and has been active in national restaurants and produce marketing groups I didn t realize when I was starting

cooperation maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth Okamoto s appointment as the IMF s second in command in March 2020 came just as the COVID 19 pandemic shut down economies worldwide My first day in my post was at home with the pandemic wave rippling across the world and the global economy being tossed into chaos he recalls The IMF provided critical financial assistance to 100 countries after the onset of the pandemic helping to sustain lives and livelihoods and prevent poverty while national economies stumbled and froze Public service has given me an opportunity to impact the lives of millions if not billions of people globally Okamoto says Few professions and positions allow for this kind of impact Economics and finance were not Okamoto s first career choice and he says most people think it is peculiar that his college degree is in technology But I think it is a huge benefit that I was trained at Cal Poly in a very systematic approach to diagnosing and solving problems he says This helps you break down large and seemingly insurmountable problems into smaller ones and imbues you with a mindset that is oriented towards finding workable solutions Okamoto also credits Cal Poly s integrated General Education IGE program with helping him understand the interactions and interdependencies that make the world work He recently made a large multi year gift to the Cal Poly Student Managed Investment Fund It s something I wish had existed when I was a student Okamoto says There is no substitute for practical experience managing real money especially
