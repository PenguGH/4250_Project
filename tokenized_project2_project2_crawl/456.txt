Venjaminne Fua Anthony Temm Tatiane Lima Marco Martinez Eliana Moisa Going to medical school is a common goal among biology students So it s not unusual that Venjaminne Fua a first year graduate student plans to become a doctor Growing up in a Tongan family made me aware of diseases like hypertension diabetes and stroke because I saw family members who struggled with those diseases Fua said As a child attending funerals of family members who had suffered strokes left a lasting impression that inspired him to pursue a medical career Fua has always been interested in science In Middle School he watched a YouTube video from Vlogger Vsauce that taught him about Alzheimer s That was a turning point for him I was always curious about how the human body functions and how the brain works I started wondering why people behave in certain ways Fua said He plans to become a neurologist His interest in research began when he joined Assistant Professor Tatiane Lima s lab as an undergrad That experience is why he wanted to continue at CPP as a graduate student and is now considering a dual degree of M D and Ph D Conducting research helps a lot because you get to apply everything you learn in class The faculty are passionate about teaching us science and the best way to learn is to get involved in research Fua said Lima s research seeks to understand the mechanisms that govern a host s response to a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis in humans and infects more than 40 million people in the U S and disproportionately affects marginalized communities A better understanding of the body s response may lead the way to better prevention and treatment Lima said Venjaminne arrived with a very clear plan for his career path to become a neurologist and perform research in neuroscience Although the main focus of my lab is to study the innate immune response to Toxoplasma gondii I have experience working on the transition between the acute and chronic phases of the infection in the brain When Fua joined Lima s lab he and fellow student Eliana Moisa proposed studying the parasite s affect on memory This research begun as an undergrad became his graduate thesis project We found there s potential parasite candidates than can inhibit the transcription factor that regulates the expression of a specific glutamate transporter Fua said If glutamate homeostasis can t be regulated then neuronal damage can occur Lima said Venjaminne has differentiated parasite tachyzoites acute parasite stage into bradyzoites chronic parasite stage in vitro and established a cell line model for neurons and astrocytes both of which allow us to study aspects of chronic infection in an in vitro model Additionally Venjaminne is working on an in vivo model and collecting data on spatial learning and memory Fua says his mother has been his biggest supporter He s also received encouragement from his primary physician who is a person of color There s a need for more people of color in medicine Fua said Sometimes it can be a matter of trust to have a doctor that looks like you On nights and weekends Fua works in the emergency room of a hospital He says the doctor he works with is incredibly brilliant and has taught him a lot He recounts the tale of a patient who appeared to be suffering from psychosomatic symptoms but the ER doctor ruled out the physical processes first before making the diagnosis He was impressed by the way she handled that case You see it all in ER I m exposed to all of the specialties he said In addition to his studies he s gaining valuable experience at CPP and at work that are preparing him for a successful career in medicine You can see Venjaminne Fua and Assistant Professor Tatiane Lima in the new Biological
