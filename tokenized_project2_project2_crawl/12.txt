Success PolyX April 22 2025 cpp news editor Share Art has always been part of Jayvion Campbell s agenda College however was not Campbell grew up with a passion for art and creativity flowing through him but his dream of becoming an animator was quickly dismissed by his parents Campbell however was not ready to let go I thought he said maybe we can strike a balance That s how Campbell found architecture in high school which he views as a way to help the world through design and creativity Coupled with the Temecula resident s infatuation with urban skylines and sprawl he was inspired to pursue architecture and apply to Cal Poly Pomona Campbell admires the layout and walkability of urban cities like San Francisco Tokyo and Singapore the city of his birth Los Angeles however is one of many cities that Campbell says has unwalkable conditions and limited public transit options As an architect he hopes to make cities accessible and travelable for everyone My objective has always been to change the world with my art in some sort of way he said Nowhere to Somewhere At CPP Campbell was introduced to the on campus chapter of National Organization of Minority Architects NOMAS which aims to advance minorities in the architecture field and diversity equity inclusion and representation in the industry Joining CPPNOMAS was a transformative experience for Campbell who gained valuable networking skills and opportunities through the chapter and expanded his circle in the architecture field He joined the CPPNOMAS team in the 2024 Barbara G Laurie Student Design Competition helping to design a multi modal transit center to respond to the locals and residents who were displaced by the Highway to Nowhere a failed infrastructure project in Baltimore that displaced a thriving predominantly black community The competition challenged more than 40 teams of students from across the country to design a transit hub affordable housing and community spaces while adhering to historic preservation guidelines Cal Poly Pomona s team of 20 spent six months on the project winning first place in the Southern California region and securing a spot in nationals for the first time in university history Our concept was stitching or weaving the community back together because there were so many communities and residents who were displaced because of the establishment of the highway said Campbell who helped design and present the project at the competition in October 2024 From the competition Campbell took home more than just a spot at nationals In working with a large group of people he learned how to communicate with a sizable team and gained an appreciation for the importance of design decisions This coupled with competing against several schools across the nation are all opportunities that Campbell appreciates Going to Baltimore and seeing students from different schools in an entirely different environment from California was unforgettable Campbell said Become by Believing While academically successful at Cal Poly Pomona Campbell admitted to having trouble facing the pressure of pursing architecture The major demands of several physical projects throughout the semester along with constant critiques from professors and supervisors With stressful deadlines and long hours spent on projects Campbell had to sacrifice much of his time spent on drawing video games and social activities The question if architecture was for me was definitely a question that I had first year he said I was trying to decide whether or not this would be for me because I wasn t 100 percent sure Campbell credits his peer mentor Marco Zhou 24 architecture with helping him navigate the stress of the major along with helping land his first internship with TOLO Architecture Now Campbell is designing a multifamily housing project in Santa Ana for a school project which will be entered into a competition alongside his classmates I don t think I was born to do
