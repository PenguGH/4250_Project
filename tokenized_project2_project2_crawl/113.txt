integrating knowledge of ecological systems social systems human behavior technology the arts and the humanities in the development of solutions to society s most pressing challenges including responses to climate change and inequities The consequences of climate change threaten the health of natural ecosystems and the health of cities and populations potentially exposed to extreme heat drought changing weather patterns and sea level rise These impacts only exacerbate historic inequities in our society concerning exposure to environmental negatives such as pollution as well as access to environmental positives such as parks healthy foods natural experiences and safe streets Mission The mission of our MLA program is to develop leaders in evidence based landscape architecture who

opportunities experimenting with innovative methods and technologies to develop solutions and synthesizing interdisciplinary knowledge community based knowledge connecting personal values to analyses policies and designs at multiple scales We use evidence that support the planning and design process is derived from academic research literature community engagement and the wealth of data that is increasingly accessible to inform decision making and design Education Goals To accomplish this mission our MLA curriculum is grounded in the following goals Cultivating leadership to address pressing environmental and social challenges facing communities Developing strength in design as an iterative process engaging multiple scales Effectively utilizing data and evidence to inform decision making and design Grounding insights and solutions in academic research literature Developing a sophisticated understanding of community engagement on a continuum between extractive and empowering practice

are eligible for in state residency after one year See Cost Scholarships Awards and Financial Aid Resources section for more details Can I be employed while in the program There are many landscape architecture job opportunities in the Los Angeles area and many students are employed while studying in the graduate program Based on experience it is recommended that students do not take jobs in their first year and take no more than 15 hours per week in their second and third year The program s courses are generally concentrated during three of the five working days Monday Wednesday and Friday allowing students time to be engaged outside of class with studies and employment The last six months of the program when students are engaged in their cumulating experience are quite intense and students usually reduce workloads during that time Where should I live while attending Cal Poly Pomona Many students live in nearby communities of Pomona Claremont La Verne Pasadena West Covina and elsewhere Commuting long distances is workable but at times difficult and moving closer to campus should be considered On campus housing is also available through http www cpp edu housing index shtml and through the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies http env cpp edu rs During the pandemic teaching will be offered online and thus you can live wherever you want as long as you have good internet connection Does the University offer housing option for married couples Unfortunately the university does not offer housing for married couples There are many options at affordable cost in neighborhoods around campus such as Pomona Claremont La Verne Diamond Bar Rowland Height Chino Hills etc Can I visit classes Please feel free to visit campus at any time A map is on the campus website http www cpp edu maps static and our graduate studios are in Building 2 rooms 128 129 and 130 Other classrooms are for the department are in building 3 and 7 The department website will announce special presentations and year end juries as well Mondays tend to be the best days to visit the program because classes for all three years of the graduate program meet on Mondays and you can see a good cross section of the program Class visit opportunities are along available online during the pandemic Reach out to the graduate coordinator mla cpp edu for more information Is there an optimal
