Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based in Los Angeles The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball MLB as a member club of the National League NL West Division Founded in 1883 in Brooklyn New York the team joined the NL in 1890 as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and used other monikers before settling as the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932 5 6 7 From the 1940s through the mid 1950s the Dodgers developed a fierce crosstown rivalry with the New York Yankees as the two clubs faced each other in the World Series seven times with the Dodgers losing the first five matchups before defeating them to win the franchise s first title in 1955 The Dodgers made history by breaking the baseball color line in 1947 with the debut of Jackie Robinson the first African American to play in the Major Leagues since 1884 8 Another major milestone was reached in 1956 when Don Newcombe became the first player ever to win both the Cy Young Award and the NL MVP in the same season 9 After 68 seasons in Brooklyn Dodgers owner and president Walter O Malley moved the franchise to Los Angeles before the 1958 season 10 The team played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962 11 The Dodgers found immediate success in Los Angeles winning the 1959 World Series Success continued into the 1960s their ace pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale were the cornerstones of titles in 1963 and 1965 In 1981 rookie Mexican phenom pitcher Fernando Valenzuela became a sensation and led the team to a championship he is the only player to win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season 12 The Dodgers were once again victorious in 1988 upsetting their heavily favored opponent in each series and becoming the only franchise to win multiple titles in the 1980s 13 Next came a 32 year championship drought despite 12 postseason appearances in a 17 year span and eight consecutive division titles from 2013 to 2020 It was broken when the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series 14 The Dodgers signed global sensation Shohei Ohtani in 2024 who set league and franchise records with the team en route to their eighth World Series title that season 15 One of the most successful and storied franchises in MLB the Dodgers have won eight World Series championships and a record 25 National League pennants Eleven NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers winning a total of 14 Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the club winning a total of 12 by far the most of any Major League franchise The Dodgers boast 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners twice as many as the next club This includes four consecutive Rookies of the Year from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996 From 1884 through 2024 the Dodgers all time record is 11 432 10 068 139 532 Since moving to Los Angeles in 1958 the Dodgers have a win loss record of 5 808 4 778 6 549 through the end of 2024 16 Today the Dodgers are among the most popular MLB teams enjoying large fan support both at home and on the road 17 18 19 they are widely seen as one of National League s most dominant teams 20 21 They maintain a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dating back to the two clubs start in New York City as well as a more recent rivalry with the American League s Houston Astros due to the controversy over the Astros sign stealing scandal in the 2017 World Series As of 2024 Forbes ranked the Dodgers second in MLB franchise valuation at 5 45 billion 22 History Jackie Robinson who grew up in Pasadena California broke baseball s color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers Although the team had no official nickname until 1932 they were informally nicknamed the Bridegrooms in the team s earliest years then the Superbas around the turn of the century and then the Robins named after manager Wilbert Robinson In the early 1900s sportswriter Charles Dryden nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins In 1932 the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22 1932 The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings 23 24 In 1941 the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant only to lose to the New York Yankees This marked the onset of the Dodgers Yankees rivalry as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances Led by Jackie Robinson the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era and three time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella also signed out of the Negro leagues the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time a story notably described in the 1972 book The Boys of Summer World Champions team aircraft Los Angeles International Airport 1964 Following the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn In just their second season in Los Angeles the Dodgers won their second World Series title beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959 Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963 and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965 The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees and their first against them as a Los Angeles team The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966 1974 1977 and 1978 but lost in each World Series appearance They went on to win the World Series again in 1981 thanks in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela Fernando Valenzuela The early 1980s were affectionately dubbed Fernandomania In 1988 another pitching hero Orel Hershiser again led them to a World Series victory aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder Kirk Gibson coming off the bench despite having injuries to both knees to pinch hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1 in his only appearance of the series The Dodgers won the pennant in 2017 for the first time since their world series victory in 1988 aided by a Justin Turner walk off home run on the same night of Gibson s iconic walk off home run 29 years earlier They went on to face the Houston Astros and lost in 7 games however the series became embroiled in controversy due to the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal The Dodgers won the pennant in 2018 for a second year in a row moving on to lose to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games They went on to win the World Series again in 2020 by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 6 games after playing a season shortened to 60 games due to the COVID 19 pandemic The Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City Both teams moved west for the 1958 season 25 The Brooklyn Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in the World Series 22 times while the New York San Francisco Giants have appeared in the World Series 20 times The Dodgers and Giants are tied with 8 World Series titles When the two teams were based in New York the Giants won five World Series championships and the Dodgers one After the move to California the Dodgers have won seven World Series while the Giants have won three In Brooklyn the Dodgers won the NL pennant twelve times 1890 1899 1900 1916 1920 1941 1947 1949 1952 1953 1955 1956 and the World Series in 1955 After moving to Los Angeles the team won National League pennants in 1959 1963 1965 1966 1974 1977 1978 1981 1988 2017 2018 2020 and 2024 with World Series championships in 1959 1963 1965 1981 1988 2020 and 2024 In all the Dodgers have appeared in 22 World Series nine in Brooklyn and 13 in Los Angeles Team history Brooklyn Dodgers Main article Brooklyn Dodgers The Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics borrowing the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890 They promptly won the NL Championship in their first year in the League The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms Grooms Superbas Robins and Trolley Dodgers before officially becoming the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1930s Jackie Robinson Main article Jackie Robinson For most of the first half of the 20th century no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15 1947 as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers 26 This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey s efforts The deeply religious Rickey s motivation appears to have been primarily moral although business considerations were also a factor Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement 27 This event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States the concomitant demise of the Negro leagues and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement Robinson was an exceptional player a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor The Dodgers willingness to integrate when most other teams refused to was a key factor in their 1947 1956 success They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson three time MVP Roy Campanella Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe Jim Gilliam and Joe Black Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 Move to California The PCL s Hollywood Stars logo pictured and Angels played in L A before the arrival of the Dodgers in 1958 Former Dodger greats who played in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles adorn the exterior of Dodger Stadium Real estate investor Walter O Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950 when he bought the 25 percent share of co owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of another equal partner Mrs John L Smith Shortly afterwards he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging Ebbets Field Beloved as it was Ebbets Field was no longer well served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957 O Malley wanted to build a new state of the art stadium in Brooklyn But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O Malley s plans To put pressure on the city during the 1955 season O Malley announced that the team would play seven regular season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City s Roosevelt Stadium in 1956 28 Moses and the City considered this an empty threat and did not believe O Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City After teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train it became possible to include locations in the far west Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast When O Malley heard that LA was looking for a club he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking LA offered him what New York would not a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark and own that ballpark giving him complete control over all revenue streams When the news came out NYC Mayor Robert F Wagner Jr and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World s Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers However O Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream O Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast 28 They were the first MLB teams both west and south of St Louis The Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24 1957 which the Dodgers won 2 0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates New York remained a one team town with the New York Yankees until 1962 when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange 29 Los Angeles Dodgers Main article History of the Los Angeles Dodgers The Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles On April 18 1958 the Dodgers played their first LA game defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants 6 5 before 78 672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Catcher Roy Campanella left partially paralyzed in an off season accident was never able to play in Los Angeles The 1959 World Series was played partially at the Los Angeles Coliseum while Dodger Stadium was being built Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962 With its clean simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle O Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated More importantly for the team the stadium s spacious dimensions along with other factors gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching Since moving to Los Angeles the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and seven more World Series rings 30 The Dodgers have had only three top five draft picks since the MLB Draft was introduced in 1965 and have had one top ten pick Clayton Kershaw No 7 since 1985 31 In game action at Dodger Stadium 1978 Other

term Trolley Dodgers was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn 32 In 1892 the city of Brooklyn Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898 began replacing its slow moving horse drawn trolley lines with the faster more powerful electric trolley lines 33 Within less than three years by the end of 1895 electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people 34 Brooklyn s high profile the significant number of widely reported accidents and a trolley strike in early 1895 combined to create a strong association in the public s mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging 33 Sportswriters started using the name Trolley Dodgers to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season 35 The name was shortened to on occasion the Brooklyn Dodgers as early as 1898 36 Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the Bums in reference to the team s fans and possibly because of the street character nature of Jack Dawkins the Artful Dodger in Charles Dickens Oliver Twist Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict Dem Bums the team would later use Weary Willie in promotional images and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s Other team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics Grays Grooms Bridegrooms Superbas and Robins All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team but not in any official capacity The team s legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club 37 However the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period simultaneously with these other nicknames by fans and sportswriters of the day The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932 when the word Dodgers appeared on team jerseys 5 The conclusive shift came in 1933 when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name Dodgers 6 Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932 A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out Jimmy Callahan pilot of the Pirates did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant but then goes on to comment the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played 38 What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title Buccaneers Take Last From Robins but the subtitle of the article reads Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4 Making Series An Even Break 39 Another example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series which identifies the matchup in the series as Dodgers vs Indians despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years 40 The Robins nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager Wilbert Robinson who led the team from 1914 to 1931 41 Uniforms The Dodgers home uniform has remained relatively unchanged for 80 years The Dodgers uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s The home jersey is white with Dodgers written in script across the chest in royal The road jersey is gray with Los Angeles written in script across the chest in royal The word Dodgers was first used on the front of the team s home jersey in 1933 the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized B on the left shoulder 42 The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year The Dodgers current script on a Dodger Blue background The current design was created in 1939 and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes Originally intended for the 1951 World Series for which the ballclub failed to qualify red numbers under the Dodgers script were added to the home uniform in 1952 43 The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles the city name on the road jersey changed and the stylized B was replaced with the interlocking LA on the caps in 1958 In 1970 the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had Dodgers on both the home and away uniforms The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999 and the tradition rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 when all blue satin uniforms were introduced These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the Dodgers script in white across the chest and the red number on the front These were worn with white pants and a new cap with a silver brim a top button and a Dodger logo These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season They would however bring back the blue jerseys in recent years but only wear them in spring training games In 2014 the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey a gray version with the Dodgers script instead of the city name 44 Since its introduction however the road jersey with the Dodgers script was used more often than the road jersey with the Los Angeles script so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform 45 In 2018 the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles 46 47 In 2021 the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform this time as part of the City Connect series in collaboration with Nike This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999 but with the script Los Dodgers in homage to Los Angeles Latino community The uniform is also worn with blue pants and black stripes are added to the sleeves Initially the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the Los Dodgers script but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking LA cap with a black brim The Los Dodgers script was then relocated to the right side In 2023 white pants with blue piping replaced the blue pants previously worn with the City Connect uniform 48 Midway through the 2024 season the Dodgers unveiled their second City Connect uniform The cream based uniform paid homage to the city of Los Angeles and various chapters of the city s history that are connected to the team The Los Angeles wordmark was inspired by the signage of the Dodgers original home of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and was slanted upward The number font was inspired by the mid century typefaces that were popular during the team s early years in Los Angeles The uniform also featured two different shades of blue cobalt and electric while chili red was based on the chest number colors the team had worn since the 1950s The cobalt blue cap featured the interlocking LA and script D from the Dodgers logo merged to form the LAD team code the said logo also appears as a sleeve patch Above the manufacturer s tag is the hashtag ITFDB a reference to broadcaster Vin Scully s catchphrase It s time for Dodger baseball 49 Justin Turner wearing the Dodgers primary road uniformMax Muncy wearing the Dodgers alternate road uniformClayton Kershaw wearing the Dodgers home uniform Asian players Chan Ho Park Shohei Ohtani The Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing of players from Asia mainly Japan South Korea and Taiwan Former owner Peter O Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea and building baseball fields in two Chinese cities In 1998 the Dodgers became the first major league team to open an office in Asia They were the second team to start a Japanese player first in nearly 30 years pitcher Hideo Nomo the first team to start a South Korean player pitcher Chan Ho Park and the first to start a Taiwanese player Chin Feng Chen In addition they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers from different Asian countries in one game Park Hong Chih Kuo of Taiwan and Takashi Saito of Japan In the 2008 season the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five They included Japanese pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park and Taiwanese pitcher Hong Chih Kuo and infielder Chin Lung Hu In 2005 the Dodgers Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby 50 For the 2013 season the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu with a six year 36 million contract after posting a bid of nearly 27 million to acquire him from the KBO s Hanhwa Eagles For the 2016 season the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight year 25 million contract after posting a bid of 20 million to acquire him from the NPB s Hiroshima Toyo Carp For the 2024 season the Dodgers signed free agent two way player Shohei Ohtani with a 10 year 700 million contract the largest ever in professional sports history 51 Rivalries The Dodgers rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century when the two teams were based in New York the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York but was revived with their East Coast West Coast World Series battles in 1963 1977 1978 and 1981 The Dodgers rivalries with the Philadelphia Phillies and St Louis Cardinals also dates back to their days in New York but were most fierce during the 1970s 1980s and 2000s The Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s 1980s and early 1990s The Dodgers had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes the Arizona Diamondbacks during most of the 2010s Their intra city rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels dates back to the Angels inaugural season in 1961 The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California based rivalry with the San Diego Padres dating back to the Padres inaugural season in 1969 Most recently the Dodgers have also regrown a heated rivalry against the former divisional foe Houston Astros after their move to the American League due in no small part to the controversy of the 2017 World Series Divisional San Francisco Giants Main article Dodgers Giants rivalry The Dodgers Giants rivalry is one of the oldest and fiercest rivalries in North American sports 52 53 The feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan After the 1957 season Dodgers owner Walter O Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons 54 Along the way he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham who was considering moving his team to Minnesota to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well 54 New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move 54 55 Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic cultural and political arenas for over a century and a half the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation Each team s ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent as well as the rivalry s leap from a cross city to a cross state engagement have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in American sports history 56 57 58 Unlike many other historic baseball match ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history the Dodgers Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams While the Giants have more wins in franchise history the Dodgers have the most National League pennants at 24 with the Giants following close behind at 23 The Dodgers and the Giants are tied for World Series titles at eight The 2010 World Series was the Giants first championship since moving to California while the Dodgers had won six World Series titles since their move their last title coming in the 2024 World Series 59 60 In 2021 the Dodgers and Giants both finished the regular season with over 100 wins with the latter clinching the division with a record of 107 55 The Dodgers were one game behind with a record of 106 56 relegating them to the NL Wild Card Game in which they defeated the St Louis Cardinals This resulted in the first postseason matchup between the Dodgers and Giants in the NLDS With a combined 213 regular season wins this is the most number of regular season wins between competing teams in any MLB postseason series 61 The Dodgers ultimately won in the decisive Game 5 but would lose in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champions Atlanta Braves 62 San Diego Padres Main article Padres Dodgers rivalry The Padres rivalry with the Dodgers has often been lopsided in favor of Los Angeles however recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego 63 64 The Dodgers currently lead the series 518 419 with the two teams meeting in the playoffs three times 65 The Dodgers swept the Padres in the 2020 NLDS won in five games in the 2024 NLDS and the Padres won in four games in the 2022 NLDS 66 Arizona Diamondbacks Main article Diamondbacks Dodgers rivalry The rivalry between the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks was one of the fiercest divisional matchups for multiple years particularly during the 2010s when both teams were in regular contention for control of the division 67 In addition to the elevated competition animosity rose immensely between both sides resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another occasionally escalating into several bench clearing brawls After eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19 2013 multiple Dodgers players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field 68 On December 8 2015 Zack Greinke signed a six year 206 5 million contract with the Diamondbacks in free agency Both teams met during the 2017 National League Division Series the Diamondbacks were swept 3 0 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3 0 sweep of their own as they eventually reached the World Series The Dodgers lead the series 259 193 with the teams tied 3 3 in the postseason 69 National League St Louis Cardinals Main article Cardinals Dodgers rivalry Primarily a playoff rivalry since 1892 The Dodgers and St Louis Cardinals have met 6 times in the postseason with 2 meetings in the NLCS won by the Cardinals Both teams have recently grown a history of animosity towards one another since the late 2000s as both teams often met frequently in the postseason The Dodgers have not fared as well against the Cardinals in the postseason In five prior postseason series matchups the Cardinals have won four with the Dodgers winning only the 2009 NLDS and the 2021 National League Wild Card Game 70 71 Cincinnati Reds The Dodgers former rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds was one of the most intense during the 1970s through the early 1990s 72 They often competed for the NL West division title From 1970 to 1990 they had eleven 1 2 finishes in the standings with seven of them being within 5½ games or fewer Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from 1970 1990 most notably as the Big Red Machine teams clashed frequently with the Tommy Lasorda era Dodgers teams Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said I don t think there s a rivalry like ours in either league The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers natural rivals but I don t think the feeling is there anymore It s not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers 73 The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central However they did face one another in the 1995 NLDS American League Los Angeles Angels Main article Freeway Series This rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels 74 The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area the home of both teams one could travel from one team s stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5 The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams 75 The term Freeway Series also inspired the official name of the region s NHL rivalry the Freeway Face Off Animosity between the team s fanbases grew stronger in 2005 when the Angels new team owner Arte Moreno changed the name of his ball club from the Anaheim Angels to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 76 Since the city of Anaheim is located roughly 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles the Angels franchise was ridiculed throughout the league for the contradictory nature surrounding the name especially by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt who filed a formal complaint to commissioner Bud Selig 77 Once the complaint was denied McCourt devised a t shirt mocking the crosstown rivals reading The Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles which remains popular amongst the fanbase to this day 78 New York Yankees Main articles Dodgers Yankees rivalry and Subway Series The Dodgers rivalry with the New York Yankees is one of the most well known rivalries in Major League Baseball 79 The two teams have met twelve times in the World Series more times than any other two teams from the American and National Leagues 79 The initial significance was embodied in the two teams proximity in New York City when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the two largest cities on opposite sides of the United States since the 1980s Although the rivalry s significance arose from the two teams numerous World Series meetings the Yankees and Dodgers had gone 40 years without meeting in the World Series from 1981 until 2024 79 They would not play each other in a non exhibition game until 2004 when they played a three game interleague series 79 Their last meeting in the regular season was in June 2024 when the Dodgers won two out of three games in New York 80 Houston Astros The rivalry between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros had initially begun as a divisional matchup but hostility waned following Houston s realignment to the American League In 2017 the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros won the championship in 7 games The rivalry was re intensified after the Astros widely publicized sign stealing scandal in which it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs including during the 2017 World Series As a result of the scandal hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans 81 The Dodgers lead the all time series 400 334 both teams are tied in postseason wins 6 6 Fan support A fan waves a rally towel during the 2008 National League Championship Series NLCS In 2012 a Bleacher Report article referred to Dodgers fans as the best sports fanbase in Los Angeles 82 Following the team s relocation to California attendance had gone from eleventh during their final season in Brooklyn to second in their first season in Los Angeles 83 Initially during construction of Dodger Stadium Walter O Malley feared the size of the ballpark would prove to be too difficult to fill on a regular basis once completed in 1962 This proved not to be the case as the Dodgers led the league in attendance by a sizeable margin for the 1962 season nearly doubling that of the New York Yankees 84 85 Attendance records In 1978 the Dodgers became the first MLB team to attract more than three million fans in a season and repeated the feat six more times before any other franchise reached three million fans overall 17 The Dodgers drew at least three million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010 the longest such streak among all MLB teams 17 The team s largest fan club Pantone 294 a reference to the Pantone code of Dodger blue regularly travels to away games to cheer for the Dodgers 86 The Dodgers have regularly placed in the top three in attendance or have led the league numerous times since 2000 excluding the 2020 season the Dodgers have recently led the league in attendance for nine straight seasons going back to 2013 87 88 89 On July 3 2007 Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance dating back to 1901 had reached 175 million a record for all professional sports 90 In 2007 the Dodgers set a franchise record for single season attendance attracting over 3 8 million fans 91 On March 28 2008 the Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers 50th anniversary with 115 300 fans in attendance 92 In 2009 the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance 18 The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales 93 Primarily Dodgers fans originate from most of southern or central California and also parts of southern Nevada The fanbase has also extended out to states across the southwest such as Arizona New Mexico and even western Texas 94 95 In 2015 Vivid Seats reported that the Dodgers were the most popular MLB team in Utah based on ticket sales 96 Dodgers away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expats and traveling fans 97 Given the team s proximity to Hollywood numerous celebrities can often be seen attending home games at Dodger Stadium Celebrities such as co owner Magic Johnson Flea Mary Hart DaBaby Larry King Tiger Woods Alyssa Milano Shia LaBeouf George Lopez Lana Del Rey Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher 98 are known to frequently attend Dodger games with some sitting at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan 99 Home attendance

657 International Abroad the Dodgers have a strongly devoted following in Mexico due to the impact of Mexican players such as Fernando Valenzuela Ismael Valdéz or more recently Julio Urias The impact of the Dodgers extensive fanbase across Mexico and among the Mexican American community is ever present as an estimated 54 of fans in home attendance are of Mexican descent 101 102 103 Notably Mel Almada the first Mexican born player in league history was also a southern California native he played for the Dodgers near the tail end of his career in 1939 The fanbase is also present throughout Asian countries such as South Korea Taiwan and Japan due to the impacts of Japanese players such as Hideo Nomo Hiroki Kuroda Kenta Maeda or Yu Darvish The Dodgers grew fan attention in South Korea as they became the first MLB team to sign the first South Korean born player in league history Chan Ho Park in 1994 The Dodgers had also strengthened their ties with their recruitment of South Korean players following the signing of All Star pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu in 2013 The team partnered with the Korean communities of Los Angeles and began hosting an annual Korean Heritage night since 2016 104 The Dodgers made history for signing the first Taiwanese player in MLB Chin Feng Chen in 2002 other Taiwanese players such as Chin Lung Hu and Chin Hui Tsao would also eventually sign with the Dodgers largely growing fan support from the country 105 106 The Dodgers increased their focus on growing a Japanese fanbase in 2024 amid their signing of Shohei Ohtani including theme nights in collaboration with Japanese companies such as Sanrio which sponsored a Hello Kitty night headlined by the national anthem being performed by Japanese musician and X Japan member Yoshiki 107 and VTuber agency Hololive which also coincided with Los Angeles Anime Expo 108 Radio and television Main article List of Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasters Hall of Fame Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully As of 2023 the primary play by play announcers on television and radio respectively are Joe Davis and Charley Steiner with Orel Hershiser TV and Rick Monday radio working as the primary color commentators On some games Stephen Nelson would fill in for Davis during his national assignments with Fox Sports with Davis typically working as the lead voice of the MLB on Fox and as one of the play by play voices of the NFL on Fox Nomar Garciaparra Eric Karros Dontrelle Willis and Jessica Mendoza often fill in for Hershiser on select games On the radio side Tim Neverett works play by play on select games and also fills in for Davis on television broadcasts 109 From 1950 to 2016 almost all Dodger games were called by Vin Scully 110 His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett 1956 1987 and Ross Porter 1977 2004 110 In 1976 he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality on the field or off in the team s history He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame s Ford C Frick Award for broadcasters inducted in 1982 Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on air conversation usually with one functioning as play by play announcer and the other s as color commentator Scully Doggett and Porter generally called games solo trading with each other inning by inning In the 1980s and 1990s Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called often referring to the listeners as friends instead of fans 111 When Doggett retired after the 1987 season he was replaced by Hall of Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox 110 Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993 This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on air until Drysdale s family had been notified and the official announcement made 112 He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday 110 Porter s tenure ended after the 2004 season after which the format of play by play announcers and color commentators was installed led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner 110 Scully however continued to announce solo Scully called roughly 100 games per season all home games and road games in California and Arizona 113 for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for Spectrum SportsNet LA Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances then announced only for the TV audience If Scully was calling the game Steiner took over play by play on the radio beginning with the fourth inning with Monday as color commentator 113 If Scully was not calling the game Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio In the event the Dodgers were in post season play Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone and Steiner Monday handled the middle innings 114 Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016 His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years Youthful announcer Joe Davis was selected in 2017 by Dodgers management to handle play by play on television with Orel Hershiser as his colorman The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in two other languages Spanish and Korean Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1958 the Dodgers became the first MLB team with a Spanish language flagship station KWKW 1300 AM with a broadcast team that included René Cárdenas 115 116 From 1959 to 2022 the Spanish play by play was voiced by another Frick Award winner Jaime Jarrín Until his death in 2024 a color analyst for some games was former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela for whom Jarrin once translated post game interviews Valenzuela was joined on the Spanish booth in 2023 and 2024 by Pepe Yñiguez and José Mota son of Dodger legend Manny Mota 109 The Spanish language radio flagship station is KTNQ Meanwhile the Dodgers Korean broadcast began in 2013 through KMPC 117 118 Management Main article List of Los Angeles Dodgers owners and executives Owner Guggenheim Baseball Management Chairman Controlling

Campanella and Robinson were the first Dodgers to have their numbers retired in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4 1972 Although other MLB teams had already been retiring numbers for decades the Dodgers were late to the trend The Dodgers had wanted to retire Robinson s No 42 for some time but Robinson had consistently rejected the honor due to a long running grudge with Dodgers owner Walter O Malley 120 Robinson did not agree to appear at a number retirement ceremony until O Malley handed over control of the team to his son Peter in 1970 121 Although the Dodgers website states that there are no written criteria for retiring uniform numbers the team has historically retired only the numbers of individuals who played most of their career with the Dodgers and are members of the Baseball Hall of Fame 122 Underscoring the principle Koufax Snider Reese Drysdale Lasorda Sutton and Hodges all had their numbers retired during the seasons in which they were inducted into the Hall Robinson and Campanella had already been Hall of Famers for several years when their numbers were retired in 1972 There have only been three exceptions Manager Walter Alston s number was retired in 1977 the season after he retired as the Dodgers manager At the time he retired he had four World Series rings and was fifth all time in managerial wins Alston entered the Hall in 1983 123 Infielder and assistant coach Jim Gilliam s number was retired in 1978 two days after his untimely death Gilliam spent 28 years with the Dodgers organization and was still coaching the team when he died 124 Pitcher and broadcaster Fernando Valenzuela s number was retired in 2023 one year before his death from liver cancer 125 The Dodgers had previously declined to issue Valenzuela s No 34 to any new players out of respect for Valenzuela s special role in Dodger history 126 127 In a strange coincidence Valenzuela spent 34 years with the Dodgers organization Like Gilliam he was still working for the team when he died 125 In 1997 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number Robinson s No 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball Robinson is the only major league baseball player so honored Starting in the 2007 season Jackie Robinson Day April 15 commemorating the Opening Day of Robinson s rookie season of 1947 has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson A broader term the Dodgers Ring of Honor includes both the retired numbers and three non baseball personnel whose insignia are displayed alongside the retired numbers Longtime broadcasters Vin Scully English and Jaime Jarrín Spanish are honored with microphone symbols 128 129 Team owner Walter O Malley who moved the Dodgers to Los

nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid 1996 the Dodgers employed only two managers Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda both of whom are in the Hall of Fame During this entire time period of extraordinary

was John Ramsey who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982 he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena and the Forum Ramsey died in 1990 From 1958 to 1982 Doug Moore Philip Petty and Dennis Packer served as back up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers California Angels Los Angeles Chargers USC football and Los Angeles Rams Packer was Ramsey s primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey s retirement from the Forum in 1978 Thereafter Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers Kings indoor soccer and indoor tennis events at the Forum Nick Nickson a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full time Dennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25 1990 by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey s opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game His replacement in 1994 was Mike Carlucci who remained as the Dodgers PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties From 2003 to 2014 the
