child and started our own company in the field we studied at CPP We actually met because we had multiple classes together 1 quarter Class of 2012 Go Broncos Brian Valentina We first met by the business building That was her major but not mine We were at the Japanese garden and thought it d be nice if we were together but we weren t We would talk in the BSC but this time we decided to make it official We married years later on the same date and it was during the pandemic We couldn t have a wedding but we had each other We are often busy now with our son but still enjoy making new memories at Cal Poly Pomona Eduardo Rikki My name is Ed my wife Rikki Smith and I were both architecture students in the late 1980 s early 90 s I had taken notice of Rikki a few times in the ENV Bldg but I did not know if we were in the same program as we shared the bldg with Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture students as well Our fateful first meeting occurred while we were studying abroad in 1990 we met at the lobby of the Sorbonne University dormitories where we were staying while studying in Paris I was soaked from head to toe as I was the last to arrive to our destination and I was walking in a rainstorm with a wet map trying to locate the dormitory I believe she made fun of me for being drenched and the conversation began our conversation grew from beautiful locale to locale taking in the architectural wonders embracing the local cultures and the wonderful journeys via trains and ferry s We traveled from France our friendship was established to Italy Venezia was the location of our first kiss to Athens Greece where the long studio hours led to a deeper understanding of who we were as people and what we wanted from our respective careers and future as a whole After 1 month of knowing each other while our friends were enjoying a concert at the Acropolis Rikki and I walked across to The Aeropagus where the locals would sit and enjoy the Athenian sunset and city lights as well as those of the lit up Parthenon at our backs The dynamic of the beauty of the location the laughter and music of the locals created a moment that was surreal and one that needed to be captured at that moment I got on one knee and proposed to her to my surprise she said yes This was chapter one of our book I graduated with a Bachelors of Architecture degree in 1991 and Rikki was a dual major graduating in 1993 with bachelor degrees in Architecture and Civil Engineering We got married in 1994 we will be celebrating our 30 years of marriage this December 2024 Rikki is a

after 8 years 3 years of dating we are engaged Kathy Chuck My husband of 45 years and I met while attending Cal Poly Pomona in the 70 s I was a Home Economics Major and he was in the Engineering Department I would bake him cookies in the classroom and then sit outside his classroom to share the cookies with him when he came out We only attended one class together and that was softball When the coach handed out our grades he was horrified to see he got a B fearing that I would have gotten a C We had a big laugh when I told him I got an A In our free time we would climb back in the hills where the avocado trees were and help ourselves Whenever we went out on a date it was a dutch date where we split the cost because both of us were starving students and we paid our own way through college Kipp Love Story My husband and I met at Cal Poly Pomona back around 2006 through his roommate and friend I was an active member of Zeta Tau Alpha and he was an active member of Sigma Phi Epsilon We re celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary in March and our daughter is 4 years old Melinda Love Story Thought I d Share our story Wasn t much of a coffee drinker so I never really hit

her was Hi I see you go to CPP too After our first date we drove by the campus and I attempted to show her how to ride a skateboard Eventually Olivia and I began hanging out during our breaks on campus and our relationship with one another blossomed We still talk about how we used to take turns bringing each other lunch I majored in psychology and graduated in 2022 and she majored in animal

girlfriend during a walk after class behind the Bronco Student Center and we dated for 6 years before we got engaged Sheryl was 3 years ahead of me so once she graduated with her degree in Kinesiology in 2011 she worked full time to help me finish school I had joined Air Force ROTC by this time so I was driving back and forth from Cal State San Bernardino where the program was I finally finished my

Sheryl works from home managing her two small businesses and part time travel agent We ve made it to the CPP Pumpkin Patch for the past three years in a row and will miss it until we make our way back home one day Uriel Yuridiana My wife and I met at Cal Poly Pomona in 2008 and are now married with three kids Taylor Robin My now husband and I met at CPP We had the same major Agribusiness Management where we took a lot of the same classes and participated in our major s club We didn t have a conventional beginning though We had a leadership class together and had a group project that we were supposed to be working on He was talking with another group member about something completely unrelated and I was trying to get us back on track since we had to present to the rest of the class He waved me off and said he d handle the presentation and to not worry about it So I did just that However when it came time to present he got up stated that there was good conversation with our group and then to my horror passed it off to me So I scrambled and presented but as you can imagine was furious Not sure how we ended up dating after that but fast forward we both graduated in 2014 were engaged in 2019 got married in 2020 and just had our first child 1 4 2024 Catherine Riley We actually met through a mutual friend another Bronco who persuaded us to join club leadership with them Then the pandemic hit and everything moved online We spent most of our time together on Discord and were soon organizing small allegedly platonic outings like going to a drive in theater to see a movie pandemic times right and eventually Catherine knew she needed Riley in her life as more than just a friend and Riley was more than happy to say yes Just over 3 years later we re now happily engaged and looking forward to a beautiful future together Dana Alex We Initially met at Cal Poly Pomona during our freshman year Fall of 2016 in Professor Casey s Englishclass Little did we know how special we would become to one another in the future Professor Casey encouraged us to connect with our other classmates After class that day Alex decided to ask for my number He then proceeded to ask me to go to lunch with him sadly I turned down the invitation since I had other commitments I did remember he would also walk me to my car even if it made him little late for his next class he would then run off to try to make it on time Although we did not begin a relationship during that time Alex left a positive impression on me that would make the difference in the years to come About 4 years later in March 2021 with no contact since freshman year we noticed each other online on Facebook Messenger and I casually told my sister about him that night The next night Alex coincidentally decided to reply to my last message from 2017 It seemed crazy that we had both thought about each other around the same time A lot had changed in that time but we decided to meet up later that month when he visited home from the Air Force I had since graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in 2020 We met we laughed and the rest was history We have since been together in a long distance relationship for two and a half years In July 2023 Alex and I planned to visit the CPP campus together since we hadn t been there together since we met in 2016 We walked past the English building where we met and made a couple of stops along our way towards the rose garden Once we reached the gazebo at the rose garden Alex spoke to me and then got down on one knee and proposed to me And after he proposed I heard a group of people start to clap and cheer When I turned around to my surprise I realized that it was actually a group of our close family and friends who Alex had invited to witness our proposal I couldn t believe how well they all had been hiding behind the business building I was overcome with emotion As we make plans for our future we still love to reminisce on these memories We have learned that Love is sometimes hidden in the places one least expects and we ll always be thankful that we were able to meet during our time at Cal Poly Pomona Apply Maps Visit Contact Us Copyright 2025 California
