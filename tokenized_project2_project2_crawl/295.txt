Alumnus Using my corporate experience I try to give students a deep perspective of the real world workplace what employers are looking for and how career progression decisions are made I specifically remember a student who was concerned that he did not have the desired internships or work experience for a career in investment banking But through his hard work my advice on professionalism and the intellectual knowledge he obtained through our classes he landed multiple offers prior to graduation Executive in Residence Bronco Mentorship Excellence Program Director Clark Rucker clarkrucker
