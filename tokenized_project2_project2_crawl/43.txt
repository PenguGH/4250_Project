Lab of Urban Wildlife and Conservation Education Ortiz says the Lyle Center is part of the Urban Wildlife Information Network one of 20 sites in the San Gabriel Valley that includes the university s Voorhis Preserve The project involves setting up cameras to capture pictures of wildlife at night when humans are not around Footage captured both common and uncommon species birds of prey like Barn Owls and a Western Screech owl bobcats and a bear in 2023 signal responses to human activity and show seasonal movements when animals like mule deer seek out resources like mates and food when there is a lot of green vegetation These observations become foundational to student research projects that range from studying coyote activities to the characteristics of green space that attract wildlife
