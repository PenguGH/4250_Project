portion of the professional life to the department and its vision and mission and have a professional and personal commitment to its continued success What is Civil Engineering Civil engineers design build operate and maintain structures and infrastructure that form the built environment of our modern society The built environment include buildings bridges highways water supply systems environmental protection systems ports railroads dams flood control works airports and many others The American Society of Civil Engineers notes that civil engineers provide a better world by design because their projects improve the quality of life for mankind while being economically viable and environmentally conscious This is the oldest branch of engineering and will continue to be essential so long as civilization exists Civil engineering is an exciting and rewarding profession Branches of Civil Engineering Civil engineering is a very broad profession that encompasses a wide range of activities The Civil Engineering Department at Cal Poly Pomona is divided into the following branches Construction Engineering and Management B S Building the Gold Line of the Metro s light rail system Cal Poly Pomona s Bachelor of Science in construction engineering technology program has produced over 1 000 graduates since its inception in 1971 In fall 2018 the name of the construction engineering technology program changed to construction engineering and management The construction engineering and management program provides the student with a firm background in construction practices Graduates may eventually work in any area of construction including commercial heavy civil and residential Construction engineering and management graduates work with owners developers architects engineers civil mechanical and electrical building departments governmental agencies contractors and subcontractors to implement a variety of construction projects Job titles include field engineer project engineer superintendent as well as estimator scheduler and project manager Construction engineers oversee the actual construction of civil engineering projects They start with the design drawings and specifications prepared by design engineers and convert them into a physical reality Students interested in this branch of civil engineering can major in either civil engineering or construction engineering and management Some students also choose to do a double major Construction Engineering and Management B S Cal Poly Pomona s Bachelor of Science in construction engineering technology program has produced over 1 000 graduates since its inception in 1971 In fall 2018 the name of the construction engineering technology program changed to construction engineering and management The construction engineering and management program provides the student with a firm background in construction practices Graduates may eventually work in any area of construction including commercial heavy civil and residential Construction engineering and management graduates work with owners developers architects engineers civil mechanical and electrical building departments governmental agencies contractors and subcontractors to implement a variety of construction projects Job titles include field engineer project engineer superintendent as well as estimator scheduler and project manager Construction management includes leading coordinating overseeing and other similar management activities as applied to construction projects Engineering managers typically have an undergraduate degree in engineering with additional education or experience in management Civil Engineering B S Environmental Engineering The environmental engineering option includes a range of civil engineering coursework with an emphasis on air and water quality biology and water supply systems This option is particularly appealing to students who are interested in developing remediation strategies for contaminated sites designing and managing drinking water wastewater and storm water systems and reducing waste streams and energy use Environmental engineering is recognized by the U S Department of Labor as one of the fastest growing fields in engineering Sanitary landfills provide safe disposal of municipal wastes thus protecting the environment The pipelines shown in the photo collect methane gas from the landfill which is then used to generate electricity Environmental engineering focuses on engineering works that clean and protect the environment These projects can include designing facilities to safely handle solid waste industrial waste or municipal wastewater It also can include identifying and remediating existing pollution such as underground contaminant plumes It has been said that civil engineers have saved more lives than doctors and much of this benefit has come from environmental engineering Civil Engineering B S Geospatial Engineering The geospatial engineering option includes a range of civil engineering coursework with an emphasis on surveying remote sensing photogrammetry geographical information systems and global positioning systems This option prepares students to ultimately become licensed civil engineers and licensed land surveyors and thus is especially attractive for those who intend to become land development engineers Using a surveying instrument to record topographic data in the field Geospatial engineering includes surveying mapping remote sensing and other similar activities Geospatial engineers use precise global positioning system GPS receivers and 3D scanners to establish horizontal and vertical coordinates They also participate in the design and implementation of geographical information systems GIS which are geographically based computer databases Civil Engineering M S Geotechnical Engineering Geotechnical engineers focus on soil rock and underground water and their relation to the design construction and operation of civil engineering projects This work includes providing adequate foundations for structures preventing or repairing landslides identifying and remediating liquefaction hazards and other similar activities Civil Engineering M S Structural Engineering Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida is a cable stayed bridge Structural engineers work on buildings bridges towers and other structures They are responsible for designing these structures in a way that will be safe sustainable and economical One of the most important aspects of structural engineering in California is earthquake resistant design Civil Engineering M S Transportation Engineering High speed maglev trains are one solution to intercity travel Transportation engineers provide fast efficient and safe transportation facilities These include highways railroads ports airports and other similar projects Transportation facilities are essential to society and improving our transportation infrastructure is a high priority for the coming decades all of which requires civil engineers with expertise in transportation engineering Water Resources Engineering A water treatment plant purifies municipal water before it is distributed to the community Water resources engineering includes various civil engineering projects needed to provide safe drinking water and flood control works These projects include aqueducts pipelines water treatment plants dams levees and other similar works Water is a very important topic in California and water shortages will become an ever growing concern as the state s population continues to grow The implementation of desalinization plants more efficient water usage and new water distribution facilities are some of the solutions to these problems all of which require civil engineers with expertise in water resources Apply Maps Visit Contact Us Copyright 2025 California State Polytechnic University Pomona All Rights Reserved A campus of The California
