AM 9 409 Remote Pilotless Vehicle Students Erick Piche Diego Diaz Edward Galindo Felipe O Tellez Advisor Tamer Omar Description Abstract The nationwide shortage of firefighters coupled with the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires necessitates innovative and cost effective solutions Autonomous ground vehicles provide a promising approach to addressing these challenges by assisting in fire suppression and emergency response However while existing autonomous fire emergency vehicles are available their high costs often exceeding tens of thousands of dollars restrict widespread adoption This project addresses the cost barrier by developing an affordable autonomous ground vehicle capable of aiding in fire emergencies The vehicle is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 5 connected to thermal cameras enabling real time fire detection heat mapping and hazard assessment A Raspberry Pi 4 is dedicated to handling the vehicle s mechanical controls including braking acceleration shifting and capturing live video feeds for remote monitoring and navigation Another Raspberry Pi 4 manages the vehicle s fire suppression system by controlling a mechanical arm that triggers the fire extinguisher Additionally stepper motors are used to direct the hose connected to the fire extinguisher allowing precise targeting of flames By leveraging inexpensive readily available components this project significantly reduces costs achieving autonomous fire suppression at just one fifth the expense of traditional alternatives This approach makes firefighting technology more accessible enabling a broader deployment of autonomous vehicles to combat wildfires and other fire emergencies effectively 11 10 AM 11 25 AM 9 409 The Sustainable Smart Home Project Achieving Net Carbon Neutrality with

Tamer Omar Description Abstract This senior design project explores the use of software defined radios SDRs for drone detection and drone replay attacks With the increasing presence of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs in various industries security concerns have arisen regarding unauthorized drone activity This project focuses on detecting drones using radios frequency RF signals and machine learning models trained on a dataset of drone commands The system captures and processes RF signals with a HackRF SDR utilizing Universal Radio Hacker URH and GNU Radio for analysis Machine learning techniques including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCC and the k Nearest Neighbors kNN classification algorithm are used to identify drone types based on their RF signatures Additionally the project investigates replay attacks where captured signals are re transmitted to interfere with drone operations automatically via an executable giving operators discretion in regards on when to use the

RBAC Students Audry L Molinari Hadas Ben Noun Victor E Mendoza Nicholas J Heckers Advisor Valerio Formicola Sponsor Kwikset Smartlocks Description Abstract In high security environments the misalignment between physical access and logical access rights presents a significant vulnerability particularly against internal attackers To address this we propose a Zero Trust architecture that continuously verifies user identity by correlating two independent data streams logical signals generated by a user s interactions with a system and physical signals captured by a remote camera based biometric system Unlike traditional setups where biometric sensors are integrated with the login terminal our framework decouples the two ensuring that the camera continuously recognizes and verifies the individual s identity and associated role This dual layer authentication model leverages Role Based Access Control RBAC to map and validate that the recognized physical identity and role are consistent with the user s logical activities By maintaining a continuous dynamic verification loop between these disparate signals the system enforces the Zero Trust principle of never trust always verify significantly mitigating risks associated with internal breaches and ensuring robust access control Building 9 Fourth Floor Integrated Cybersecurity Monitoring for Radar Systems A Combined OT
