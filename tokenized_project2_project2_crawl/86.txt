College Giving Michael J Bidart s Generous Gift to CLASS at Cal Poly Pomona A Legacy Rooted in Gratitude March 17 2025 Michael J Bidart a prominent attorney and alumnus of Cal Poly Pomona has donated 100 000 to the College of Letters Arts and Social Sciences CLASS s California Center for Ethics and Policy CCEP to establish the Bernard and Lucie Bidart CCEP Fellowship His contribution exemplifies his gratitude for the transformative education he received and his commitment to helping the next generation of students succeed Raised on a dairy farm Bidart s parents though not formally educated instilled in him the values of generosity and hard work My parents were both very generous people Bidart said They didn t have a lot economically to give but they were very giving people They were good to their family they were good to their friends and I pretty much felt an obligation to give to the university where I was fortunate to go As a first generation student Bidart balanced his studies at Cal Poly Pomona with service in the California Air National Guard during the Vietnam War His time at the university though marked by challenges including the loss of his mother to breast cancer set the foundation for his future Professors like Dr Sidney Blumner played a pivotal role in Bidart s success I had a very dear friend who was my professor at Cal Poly his name is Dr Sidney Blumner and he was an inspirational teacher for me Bidart said He and his family had set up a similar scholarship in his parents name there at Cal Poly And so I basically followed that lead and wanted to do the same Bidart s gift reflects his belief in the power of education to create opportunities for students from underserved backgrounds I think just providing for people like myself who came from circumstances where their parents were not educated but they valued education is changing their lives and giving them an opportunity and making them feel worthwhile Beyond his philanthropic contributions Bidart has had a distinguished legal career As managing partner at Shernoff Bidart Echeverria LLP he has won landmark cases including a 120 5 million verdict against Aetna and has consistently been recognized as a Super Lawyer His work has shaped healthcare and consumer rights litigation protecting vulnerable populations nationwide Through both his career and philanthropy Bidart demonstrates a commitment to justice education and giving back His advice to students is simple yet powerful reflecting the wisdom of his late father My dad used to ask me in Basque Are you doing your best Bidart recalled That s all that mattered Just do your best Don t take shortcuts That s all you can expect of a person Bidart hopes his gift will inspire others to contribute to Cal Poly Pomona My hope is that other students who are fortunate enough to later do well in their careers will give back he said It s like anything else It s a causal chain One deed begets another And if it s a good deed the hope is that it will beget and give birth to future good deeds Michael Bidart s generosity is a testament to the power of education the influence of mentorship and the lasting impact of giving back His support ensures Cal Poly Pomona will continue to provide opportunities and transform lives for years to come About the California Center for Ethics and Policy CCEP The
