Diversity Provides Community Support and a Path to Success December 4 2024 Cal Poly Pomona is a Hispanic serving institution HSI so it may not be surprising that biology graduate student Ximena Corona was born in Guadalajara Mexico Her father was a doctor and her mother a dietician When Corona was five the family traveled to Bakersfield for a funeral Due to a prolonged stay her parents enrolled her in a school program for newly immigrated students The school gave her a backpack full of books and supplies and when her parents saw how happy she was to attend school here and how quickly she was picking up English they decided that staying would allow Ximena an opportunity for a better education The family settled in Bakersfield and her parents started a business cleaning stores and offices Ximena wrote business communications for her parents and helped with translation when needed She also pitched in and helped with the cleaning at night after school From an early age Corona was interested in learning She excelled but didn t always find the support she needed Some teachers had assumptions about immigrants She was placed in combination classes with students from lower grades and wasn t allowed to test for the Gifted and Talented Education GATE program even though her test results warranted it In contrast Here at CPP my background is celebrated Corona said In Bakersfield she got a full ride scholarship for a private Christian middle school They had never had an undocumented student and they put her in lower levels of math As a result she had to take summer school in her freshman and sophomore years of high school to be at the same math level as most of her peers The public high school she went to was a top performing school that gave her the tools she needed to excel academically and she was accepted into their medical academy program My father was a strong role model Harvard is waiting for you He would say I wouldn t be as successful as I am without my dad rooting me on she said In high school she continued to help her parents business while also babysitting her three younger sisters The business became successful making it economically feasible for Corona to attend college and she came to Cal Poly Pomona During the pandemic Corona withdrew from CPP to plan her departure from a domestically violent relationship When she returned she found herself with a new found perspective on the direction she wanted her career and personal life to go She recounts I joined the Science Council because I desperately needed community as I felt alone and derailed from my goals There I found the most supportive individuals and became exposed to the vast careers and opportunities that could lay ahead for me as a scientist I also knew I could contribute the leadership skills and knowledge I had acquired to serve the College of Science It was a deeply transformative time that solidified my interest in pursuing a Ph D Being surrounded by peers working towards similar goals studying the same long hours and most importantly sharing the same motivation to one day be in spaces that were not made with us in mind made working towards what felt impossible into a reality She participated in the Science Educational Enhancement Services SEES program which also offers peer support and she won the SEES Dora Anderson award which honors students who have overcome exceptional barriers to succeed In pursuit of her goal to become a doctor she volunteered at hospitals and shadowed doctors but found the volume of patients was not appealing At CPP when she saw Associate Professor Francie Mercer conducting research on trichomoniasis Corona said I decided I really want to do research especially cell and molecular biology Corona won a 2024 Howell CSU Biotech Research Scholar Award for her proposal titled Disturbing Degranulation in Neutrophil Like Cells and Investigating how Degranulation Deficiency Impacts Trogocytic Killing In the interest of helping other students she and another student started a chapter of SACNAS on campus SACNAS is the Society for Advancement of Chicanas Hispanic and Native Americans in Science She graduated with her bachelor of science degree in biology in May 2024 is now working on her master s degree and plans to get her Ph D She s part of the Bridges to Ph D Program B2D Corona shared I wouldn t be here if it wasn t for them believing in me from faculty to students to administration Although I don t have everything figured out the advancement and change that I can bring about through policy enactments or through scientific innovation excites me for my future career in biomedical science Ximena Corona is also featured in a College of Science video where she shares why she chose Cal Poly Pomona to study
