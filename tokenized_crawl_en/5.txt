else From the start of the challenge I just went in and got all the experience I could and Avanade was there to support me brought me to the Microsoft campus to expose me to the industry and I just absorbed it Marquez said It was such an opportunity for me to grow and learn initially As I graduated and started full time with Avanade I took the opportunity to give back right away and helped support all scholarship programs to bring in the next generation Marquez was accompanied by Jackie Mendoza 21 computer information systems from the second cohort Mendoza a consultant in software engineering project management at Avanade shared her experience as a first generation student who previously worked two jobs to support her college education Avanade talked about mentorship and I was hesitant because when you talk about mentorship it s call me if you need me But Avanade really took mentorship seriously and changed the game for me Mendoza said Through being a STEM scholar I was exposed to industry leaders They let me talk to and play with tech and learn to fail in a safe environment The event also featured keynote speakers and interactive breakout sessions hosted by the

how to use AI tools and technologies and how to address AI s impact on the teaching and learning process The university is planning an AI Summer Conference for faculty to provide more training and guidance on effectively and ethically using AI in their courses The CAFE team connects our faculty with answers to questions they may be trying to figure out said Laura Massa associate vice president of academic programs How do you query or what is the impact of AI on education How should I be thinking about this And so it doesn t necessarily tell them You need to think this way but it helps them to kind of provide context for the thinking and how they might go about approaching this in their classroom CAFE is our primary resource for faculty who want to think about how they use emerging technologies like generative AI in the teaching and learning process As for students the Science Technology and Society Program is developing an Artificial Intelligence Ethics Society program as both a major option and minor The state of California is the leader at AI hiring and we have more people hired into AI careers in this state than any other state said Alex Harwood Cal Poly Pomona s advanced computing and chief technology officer It s very important that a university like Cal Poly Pomona shows leadership in this area This program will prepare students for jobs that require technological knowledge of Al and an ability to solve problems and communicate from a broad perspective informed by ethics culture and politics It will be available to students in fall 2025 For staff
