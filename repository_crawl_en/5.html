                    <p>From new artificial intelligence-related academic programs to a public-private partnership to workshops for faculty and events for students, Cal Poly Pomona aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation.</p>
<p>The university celebrated those efforts Feb. 21, hosting a gathering of industry experts, students, Congresswoman Norma Torres and academic professionals at the inaugural Artificial Intelligence (AI) Conference. Cal Poly Pomona&#8217;s AI push comes at a time when CSU <a href="https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/CSU-AI-Powered-Initiative.aspx">Chancellor Mildred Garcia has announced efforts</a> to position the 23-campus system as the nation&#8217;s first and largest AI-powered university system.</p>
<p>Jeff Cox, interim executive director for institutional strategy and engagement at CPP, emphasized the conference&#8217;s focus on preparing students for future job markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew it was important for students to be prepared for their future career success,&#8221; Cox said. &#8220;They are going to interact with this technology in their jobs, and giving them hands-on knowledge and experience is of the utmost importance, as well as making sure that Cal Poly Pomona provides education opportunities and training.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference included a networking mixer, during which academic departments, student clubs and offices showcased the current use of AI on campus. Students from <a href="https://linktr.ee/cppmissa">Management Information Systems Student Association</a> (MISSA) and <a href="https://linktr.ee/cppfast">Forensics and Security Technology</a> (FAST) shared their current projects and opportunities to get involved.</p>
<p>Also actively working the conference was Temi, an AI robot hosted by <a href="https://www.avanade.com/en-us">Avanade</a> that helped passersby learn more about the company, a leading global provider of innovative digital services and business solutions. Temi can work in different industries and perform several tasks, from being a tour guide to an assistant nurse.</p>
<h2>A Growing Partnership</h2>
<p>The event also included a ceremonial ribbon cutting and signing of an agreement for the new Avanade AI &amp; Innovation Center located at CPP&#8217;s Innovation Village, further solidifying the decade-long partnership between the company and Cal Poly Pomona.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, Avanade has contributed over $2 million in philanthropic investments to Cal Poly Pomona. This includes the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/news/content/2015/07/avanade-pledges-five-15000-scholarships-for-women-in-information-technology/index.shtml">Avanade STEM Scholarships</a> program, The FUEL Conference, an <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/cba/ai-hackathon/index.shtml">AI Hackathon</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/cba/digital-innovation/index.shtml">Mitchell C. Hill Center for Digital Innovation</a>, which oversees a student-managed data center and faculty research projects. The late Hill (&#8217;80, economics) was the first CEO of Avanade, a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft.</p>
<p><img alt="AI Conference Ribbon Cutting" class="image-300px-float-right" height="542" src="../../../../img/news/2025/02/25ai-conference-ribbon2.jpg" width="800"/>The Avanade AI &amp; Innovation Center will serve as a vibrant center for AI research, collaboration, and learning, bridging the gap between academia and industry. It will host AI-applied research groups, sponsor events such as hackathons and workshops, showcase cutting-edge innovations, and share industry trends. This hub builds on the broader successful initiatives between Avanade and Cal Poly Pomona &#8211; all aimed at preparing students to be future-ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;This partnership with Avanade exemplifies our mission to foster innovation, inclusion and excellence in preparing our students for career success,&#8221; said University President Soraya M. Coley. &#8220;By combining our academic expertise with Avanade&#8217;s industry leadership, we are creating a platform that empowers our students and faculty to shape the future of AI and harness its transformative power responsibly. We stand at the precipice of the future, and it will take the brightest minds working at the world&#8217;s preeminent companies to ensure a better future for all, and that is why we are honored to be partnering with Avanade.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the AI Center, Avanade recently recommitted to another four years of funding for its scholarship program, providing $80,000 a year to support up to 15 students with full tuition and fees based on financial need and a pilot program for the use of virtual reality technology in education.</p>
<p>Alumna Barbara Marquez (&#8217;21, computer information systems), who was in the first cohort of scholarship recipients and works at Avanade, joined the conference to share her experience as a STEM scholar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had more opportunities than I ever saw anywhere else. From the start of the challenge, I just went in and got all the experience I could, and Avanade was there to support me, brought me to the Microsoft campus to expose me to the industry, and I just absorbed it,&#8221; Marquez said. &#8220;It was such an opportunity for me to grow and learn initially. As I graduated and started full-time with Avanade, I took the opportunity to give back right away and helped support all scholarship programs to bring in the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marquez was accompanied by Jackie Mendoza (&#8217;21, computer information systems) from the second cohort. Mendoza, a consultant in software engineering project management at Avanade, shared her experience as a first-generation student who previously worked two jobs to support her college education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avanade talked about mentorship, and I was hesitant because when you talk about mentorship, it&#8217;s, &#8216;call me if you need me.&#8217; But Avanade really took mentorship seriously and changed the game for me,&#8221; Mendoza said. &#8220;Through being a STEM scholar, I was exposed to industry leaders. They let me talk to and play with tech and learn to fail in a safe environment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img alt="Florin Rotar" class="image-300px-float-left" height="548" src="../../../../img/news/2025/02/25ai-conference-rotar15.jpg" width="800"/>The event also featured keynote speakers and interactive breakout sessions hosted by the California Center for Ethics and Policy, LinkedIn, Microsoft, and Avanade. The sessions covered various topics, from the ethics of AI to career pathways in the field to how to use the technology to enhance learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Florin Rotar, chief AI officer at Avanade, shared insights on AI readiness, adoption, value generation, and insight into the current job market. He addressed questions from the audience, discussing concerns and opportunities related to the use of AI on campus and in the job market before Sandeep Krishnamurthy, dean of the College of Business Administration, hosted an industry discussion panel.</p>
<h2>Broncos Invest in AI</h2>
<p>For Cal Poly Pomona, the push to become leaders in adapting AI includes faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/cafe/teaching-and-learning/ai/index.shtml">Center for the Advancement of Faculty Excellence</a> (CAFE) offers workshops and resources to help faculty learn how to use and incorporate AI into their teaching and curriculum.</p>
<p>CAFE has conducted a series of workshops and events to support faculty in understanding how to use AI tools and technologies and how to address AI&#8217;s impact on the teaching and learning process. The university is planning an AI Summer Conference for faculty to provide more training and guidance on effectively and ethically using AI in their courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CAFE team connects our faculty with answers to questions they may be trying to figure out,&#8221; said Laura Massa, associate vice president of academic programs. &#8220;How do you query or what is the impact of AI on education? How should I be thinking about this? And so, it doesn't necessarily tell them &#8216;You need to think this way,&#8217; but it helps them to kind of provide context for the thinking and how they might go about approaching this in their classroom. CAFE is our primary resource for faculty who want to think about how they use emerging technologies like generative AI in the teaching and learning process.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for students, the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/class/science-technology-society/">Science Technology and Society Program</a> is developing an Artificial Intelligence Ethics &amp; Society program as both a major option and minor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state of California is the leader at AI hiring, and we have more people hired into AI careers in this state than any other state,&#8221; said Alex Harwood, Cal Poly Pomona&#8217;s advanced computing and chief technology officer. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that a university like Cal Poly Pomona shows leadership in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p><span>This program will prepare students for jobs that require technological knowledge of Al and an ability to solve problems and communicate from a broad perspective informed by ethics, culture and politics. It</span> will be available to students in fall 2025.</p>
<p>For staff, the university is piloting training on AI readiness and has resources through LinkedIn Learning and <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/it/advanced-computing/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-education-series.shtml">webinars</a> hosted by Nvidia and Mark III Systems.</p>
<p>In addition, CPP will continue hosting its <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/artificial-intelligence-fair/">AI Fair</a> and <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/cba/ai-hackathon/index.shtml">Hackathon</a> on <strong>April 17</strong>. The event will highlight AI&#8217;s potential as a tool for innovation and growth and its usage across all eight colleges.</p>
